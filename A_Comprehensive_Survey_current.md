1 Introduction
Rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has precipitated a paradigm shift in how knowledge is discovered,
validated, and utilized across academic and industrial domains. Traditional research methodologies, reliant
on manual literature reviews, experimental design, and data analysis, are increasingly supplemented—and
in some cases supplanted—by intelligent systems capable of automating end-to-end research workflows. This
evolution has given rise to a novel domain we term “Deep Research”, which signifies the convergence of large
language models (LLMs), advanced information retrieval systems, and automated reasoning frameworks to
redefine the boundaries of scholarly inquiry and practical problem-solving.

# 1.1 Definition and Scope of Deep Research

Deep Research refers to the systematic application of AI technologies to automate and enhance research
processes through three core dimensions:

1. Intelligent Knowledge Discovery: Automating literature search, hypothesis generation, and pattern recognition across heterogeneous data sources
2. End-to-End Workflow Automation: Integrating experimental design, data collection, analysis, and result interpretation into unified AI-driven pipelines
3. Collaborative Intelligence Enhancement: Facilitating human-AI collaboration through natural language interfaces, visualizations, and dynamic knowledge representation

To clearly delineate the boundaries of Deep Research, we distinguish it from adjacent AI systems as
follows:

∙ Differentiating from General AI Assistants: While general AI assistants like ChatGPT can answer
research questions, they lack the autonomous workflow capabilities, specialized research tools, and
end-to-end research orchestration that define Deep Research systems. Recent surveys have highlighted
this crucial distinction between specialized research systems and general AI capabilities [73, 76],
with particular emphasis on how domain-specific tools fundamentally transform research workflows
compared to general-purpose assistants [213, 318].
∙ Differentiating from Single-Function Research Tools: Specialized tools like citation managers, liter-
ature search engines, or statistical analysis packages address isolated research functions but lack
the integrated reasoning and cross-functional orchestration of Deep Research systems. Tools like
scispace [242] and You.com [313] represent earlier attempts at research assistance but lack the
end-to-end capabilities that define true Deep Research systems.
∙ Differentiating from Pure LLM Applications: Applications that simply wrap LLMs with research-
oriented prompts lack the environmental interaction, tool integration, and workflow automation
capabilities that characterize true Deep Research systems.
This survey specifically examines systems that exhibit at least two of the three core dimensions, with
a focus on those incorporating large language models as their foundational reasoning engine. Our scope
encompasses commercial offerings such as OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], Google’s Gemini/DeepResearch
[89], and Perplexity/DeepResearch [209], alongside open-source implementations including dzhng/deep-
research [321], HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112], and numerous others detailed in subsequent sections. We
exclude purely bibliometric tools or single-stage automation systems lacking integrated cognitive capabilities,

[PAGE 5]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 5

such as research assistance tools like Elicit [74], ResearchRabbit [228], Consensus [63], or citation tools
like Scite [243]. Additional specialized tools like STORM [278], which focuses on scientific text retrieval and
organization, are valuable but lack the end-to-end deep research capabilities central to our survey scope.

# 1.2 Historical Context and Technical Evolution

The trajectory of Deep Research can be mapped through three evolutionary stages that reflect both
technological advancements and implementation approaches:

1.2.1 Origin and Early Exploration (2023 - February 2025). It should be noted that workflow automation
frameworks like [183], [224], etc. had already been in existence long before the
n8n QwenLM/Qwen-Agent
boom of deep research. Their early establishment demonstrated the pre-existing groundwork in related
technological domains, highlighting that the development landscape was not solely shaped by the emergence
of deep research, but had a more diverse and earlier-rooted origin. The concept of Deep Research emerged
from the shift of AI assistants towards intelligent agents. In December 2024, Google Gemini pioneered
this functionality with its initial Deep Research implementation, focusing on basic multi-step reasoning
and knowledge integration [60]. This phase laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements, setting the
stage for more sophisticated AI-driven research tools. Many of these advances built upon earlier workflow
automation tools like n8n [183] and agent frameworks such as AutoGPT [250] and BabyAGI [311] that had
already established foundations for autonomous task execution. Other early contributions to this ecosystem
include cline2024 [61], which pioneered integrated research workflows, and open_operator [36], which
developed foundational browser automation capabilities essential for web-based research.

1.2.2 Technological Breakthrough and Competitive Rivalry (February - March 2025). The rise of DeepSeek’s
open-source models [68] revolutionized the market with efficient reasoning and cost-effective solutions. In
February 2025, OpenAI’s release of Deep Research, marked a significant leap forward [197]. Powered by the o3
model, it demonstrated advanced capabilities such as autonomous research planning, cross-domain analysis,
and high-quality report generation, achieving accuracy rates exceeding previous benchmarks in complex tasks.
Concurrently, Perplexity launched its free-to-use Deep Research in February 2025 [209], emphasizing rapid
response and accessibility to capture the mass market. Open-source projects such as nickscamara/open-deep-
research [42], mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249], btahir_open_deep_research [37], and GPT-researcher
[16] emerged as community-driven alternatives to commercial platforms. The ecosystem continued to expand
with lightweight implementations like Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama [267], designed for local
execution with limited resources, and modular frameworks such as Langchain-AI/Open_deep_research
[131] that provided composable components for custom research workflows.

1.2.3 Ecosystem Expansion and Multi-modal Integration (March 2025 - Present). The third stage is character-
ized by the maturation of a diverse ecosystem. Open-source projects like Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch [121]
enable localized deployment and customization, while commercial closed-source versions from OpenAI and
Google continue to push boundaries with multi-modal support and multi-agent collaboration capabilities.
The integration of advanced search technologies and report generation frameworks further enhances the tool’s
utility across academic research, financial analysis, and other fields. Meanwhile, platforms like [164]
Manus
and AutoGLM-Research [330], MGX [171], and Devin [62] are incorporating advanced AI research capabilities

[PAGE 6]
6 Xu et al.

to enhance their services. Concurrently, Anthropic launched Claude/Research [13] in April 2025, introducing
agentic search capabilities that systematically explore multiple angles of queries and deliver comprehensive
answers with verifiable citations. Agent frameworks such as OpenManus [193], Camel-AI/OWL [43], and TARS
[39] further expand the ecosystem with specialized capabilities and domain-specific optimizations.

# 1.3 Significance and Practical Implications

Deep Research demonstrates transformative potential across multiple domains:

1. Academic Innovation: Accelerating hypothesis validation through automated literature synthesis (e.g., HotpotQA [307] performance benchmarks) and enabling researchers to explore broader inter-

disciplinary connections that might otherwise remain undiscovered. The transformative potential of
Deep Research extends beyond individual applications to fundamentally reshape scientific discovery
processes. As Sourati and Evans [256] argue, human-aware artificial intelligence can significantly
accelerate science by augmenting researchers’ capabilities while adapting to their conceptual frame-
works and methodological approaches. This human-AI synergy represents a fundamental shift from
traditional automation toward collaborative intelligence that respects and enhances human scientific
intuition. Complementary work by Khalili and Bouchachia [128] further demonstrates how systematic
approaches to building science discovery machines can transform hypothesis generation, experimental
design, and theory refinement through integrated AI-driven research workflows.

2. Enterprise Transformation: Enabling data-driven decision-making at scale through systems like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] and smolagents/open_deep_research [115] that can analyze market trends,

competitive landscapes, and strategic opportunities with unprecedented depth and efficiency.

3. Democratization of Knowledge: Reducing barriers to entry through open-source implementations like grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] and OpenManus [193], making sophisticated research capabilities

accessible to individuals and organizations regardless of technical expertise or resource constraints.

# 1.4 Research Questions and Contribution of this Survey

This survey addresses three fundamental questions:

1. How do architectural choices (system architecture, implementation approach, functional capabilities) impact Deep Research effectiveness?
2. What technical innovations have emerged in LLM fine-tuning, retrieval mechanisms, and workflow orchestration across the spectrum of Deep Research implementations?
3. How do existing systems balance performance, usability, and ethical considerations, and what patterns emerge from comparing approaches like those of n8n [183] and OpenAI/AgentsSDK [199]?

Our contributions manifest in three dimensions:

1. Methodological: Proposing a novel taxonomy categorizing systems by their technical architecture, from foundation models to knowledge synthesis capabilities
2. Analytical: Conducting comparative analysis of representative systems across evaluation metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different approaches
3. Practical: Identifying key challenges and formulating a roadmap for future development, with specific attention to emerging architectures and integration opportunities

The remainder of this paper follows a structured exploration beginning with conceptual frameworks
(Section 2), technical innovations and comparative analysis (Sections 3-4), implementation technologies
(Section 5), evaluation methodologies (Section 6), applications and use cases (Section 7), ethical considerations
(Section 8), and future directions (Section 9).

2 The Evolution and Technical Framework of Deep Research

This section presents a comprehensive technical taxonomy for understanding Deep Research systems,
organized around four fundamental technological capabilities that define these systems. For each capabil-
ity, we examine the evolutionary trajectory and technical innovations while highlighting representative
implementations that exemplify each approach.

# 2.1 Foundation Models and Reasoning Engines: Evolution and Advances

The foundation of Deep Research systems lies in their underlying AI models and reasoning capabilities,
which have evolved from general-purpose language models to specialized research-oriented architectures.

2.1.1 From General-Purpose LLMs to Specialized Research Models. The progression from general LLMs to
research-specialized models represents a fundamental shift in deep research capabilities:

Fig. 2. Hierarchical Technical Framework of Deep Research Systems

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early implementations relied on general-purpose LLMs with minimal
task-specific optimization. Current systems feature models specifically enhanced for research tasks through
architectural modifications, specialized training corpora, and fine-tuning regimes focused on analytical and
reasoning capabilities. The transition from models like GPT-4 to OpenAI’s o3 demonstrates significant
improvements in abstraction, multi-step reasoning, and knowledge integration capabilities essential for
complex research tasks [198, 200].

Representative Systems. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] exemplifies this evolution with its o3-based model
optimized specifically for web browsing and data analysis. The system leverages chain-of-thought and tree-of-
thought reasoning techniques to navigate complex information landscapes. Google’s Gemini/DeepResearch
[60] similarly employs Gemini 2.5 Pro with enhanced reasoning capabilities and a million-token context
window to process extensive information. These approaches build upon foundational work in reasoning
enhancement techniques like chain-of-thought prompting [291], self-consistency [287], and human preference
alignment [205] that have been adapted specifically for research-intensive tasks. In the open-source domain,
AutoGLM-Research [330] demonstrates how specialized training regimes can optimize existing models like

[PAGE 9]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 9

ChatGLM for research-intensive tasks, achieving significant performance gains through targeted enhancements
to reasoning components.

2.1.2 Context Understanding and Memory Mechanisms. The ability to process, retain, and utilize extensive
contextual information represents a crucial advancement in Deep Research systems:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early systems struggled with limited context windows, hampering their
ability to synthesize information from multiple sources. Contemporary implementations employ sophisticated
memory management techniques including episodic buffers, hierarchical compression, and attention-based
retrieval mechanisms that extend effective context far beyond model limitations. The million-token context
windows of models like Grok 3 [299] and Gemini 2.5 Pro [60], along with the context optimization in
OpenAI’s o3 model [195], have dramatically expanded the information processing capabilities of these
systems. Advanced systems now distinguish between working memory (active reasoning context) and
long-term memory (knowledge repository), allowing for more human-like research processes.

Representative Systems. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] has pioneered efficient context processing by
leveraging DeepSeek-R1’s capabilities while implementing proprietary mechanisms for structured information
management. The system can analyze hundreds of sources while maintaining coherent reasoning threads.
Similarly, Camel-AI/OWL [43] employs an innovative open-weight approach to memory management, allowing
for dynamic allocation of attention resources based on information relevance and task requirements. Both
systems demonstrate how effective memory architectures can significantly enhance research performance
even with comparable base model capabilities.

2.1.3 Enhancements in Reasoning Capabilities. Advanced reasoning mechanisms distinguish modern Deep
Research systems from conventional LLM applications:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early implementations relied primarily on zero-shot or few-shot prompting
for reasoning tasks. Current systems integrate explicit reasoning frameworks including chain-of-thought,
tree-of-thought, and graph-based reasoning architectures. Recent work by Lang et al. [132] demonstrates how
debate-driven reasoning can facilitate weak-to-strong generalization, enabling more robust performance on
complex research tasks through structured argumentative processes. These approaches implement reasoning
patterns that more closely mirror human scientific discourse, with explicit representation of alternative
viewpoints and structured evaluation of competing hypotheses. Advanced implementations like OpenAI’s
o3 incorporate self-critique, uncertainty estimation, and recursive reasoning refinement [198, 200]. This
evolution enables increasingly sophisticated forms of evidence evaluation, hypothesis testing, and knowledge
synthesis essential for high-quality research outputs.

Representative Systems. QwenLM/Qwen-Agent [224] exemplifies advanced reasoning capabilities through its
specialized toolkit integration and modular reasoning framework. The system employs a multi-stage reasoning
process with explicit planning, information gathering, analysis, and synthesis phases optimized for research
workflows. Similar capabilities are evident in smolagents/open_deep_research [115], which implements a
flexible reasoning architecture that can adapt to different research domains and methodologies. Systems like
CycleResearcher [294] demonstrate how integrating automated review processes into research workflows can
enhance accuracy through structured feedback loops. These approaches implement explicit verification steps

[PAGE 10]
10 Xu et al.

that identify potential errors and inconsistencies before generating final research outputs. The application of
AI to complex domains like mathematics further illustrates this progress, where models are increasingly
viewed from a cognitive science perspective to enhance their reasoning abilities [320], achieving notable
milestones such as silver-medal standards in solving International Mathematical Olympiad problems [7].
These systems highlight how reasoning enhancements can dramatically improve research quality even without
requiring the largest or most computationally intensive base models.

# 2.2 Tool Utilization and Environmental Interaction: Evolution and Advances

Deep Research systems must effectively interact with external environments to gather and process information,
representing a fundamental capability beyond core language model functions[144].

2.2.1 Web Interaction Technology Development. The ability to navigate and extract information from the
web represents a foundational capability for deep research:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Initial implementations relied on simple API-based search queries with
limited interaction capabilities. Current systems employ sophisticated web navigation including dynamic
content handling, authentication management, and interactive element manipulation. Advanced implementa-
tions feature semantic understanding of web structures, allowing for adaptive information extraction and
multi-page navigation flows. This evolution has dramatically expanded access to web-based information
sources and the ability to extract insights from complex web environments.

Representative Systems. Nanobrowser [184] represents a purpose-built browser environment designed
specifically for AI agent use, offering optimized rendering and interaction capabilities for research tasks.
It enables fine-grained control of web navigation while maintaining security and performance. Similarly,
AutoGLM [330] demonstrates sophisticated GUI interaction capabilities across both web and mobile interfaces,
allowing it to access information through interfaces designed for human use. These systems showcase how
specialized web interaction technologies can significantly expand the information gathering capabilities of
Deep Research systems.

2.2.2 Content Processing Technology Advancements. Beyond basic navigation, the ability to process diverse
content formats is crucial for comprehensive research:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early systems were limited primarily to text extraction from HTML
sources. Modern implementations support multi-modal content processing including structured data tables,
embedded visualizations, PDF documents, and interactive applications. Advanced systems like those built
on OpenAI’s o3 can extract semantic structure from unstructured content, identify key information from
diverse formats, and integrate insights across modalities [201]. This evolution has dramatically expanded the
range of information sources that can be incorporated into research processes.

Representative Systems. The dzhng/deep-research [321] project exemplifies advanced content processing
through its specialized modules for different document types and formats. It implements custom extraction
logic for academic papers, technical documentation, and structured data sources. Similarly, nickscamara/
open-deep-research [42] features sophisticated content normalization pipelines that transform diverse
formats into consistent knowledge representations suitable for analysis. Both systems demonstrate how

[PAGE 11]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 11

specialized content processing can significantly enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of research
outputs.

2.2.3 Specialized Tool Integration Progress. Integration with domain-specific tools extends Deep Research
capabilities beyond general information processing:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Initial systems relied on general-purpose web search and basic API
integrations. The integration of diverse tools has been dramatically advanced by frameworks like ToolLLM
[222], which enables large language models to master over 16,000 real-world APIs, significantly expanding
the interaction capabilities of research systems. Similarly, AssistGPT [82] demonstrates how general multi-
modal assistants can plan, execute, inspect, and learn across diverse environments, creating unified research
experiences that seamlessly incorporate varied information sources and interaction modalities. LLaVA-Plus
[152] further extends these capabilities through explicit tool learning mechanisms, enabling research assistants
to adaptively incorporate specialized tools within multimodal workflows. Current implementations feature
complex toolchains including specialized databases, analytical frameworks, and domain-specific services.
Advanced systems dynamically select and orchestrate tools based on research requirements, effectively
composing custom research workflows from available capabilities. Some implementations like those leveraging
OpenAI’s Codex [194] can even generate custom code to process research data or implement analytical models
on demand, further extending analytical capabilities. This evolution has enabled increasingly sophisticated
analysis and domain-specific research applications.

Representative Systems. Manus [164] exemplifies sophisticated tool orchestration through its extensive API
integration framework and tool selection mechanisms. The system can incorporate domain-specific research
tools and services into unified workflows, significantly expanding its analytical capabilities. Similarly, n8n
[183] provides a flexible workflow automation platform that can be configured for research tasks, allowing for
integration with specialized data sources and analytical services. Steward extends web interaction capabilities
by implementing natural language-driven navigation and operation across websites, overcoming scalability
limitations of traditional automation frameworks while maintaining low operational costs [261]. These
systems highlight how tool integration can extend Deep Research capabilities into specialized domains and
complex analytical workflows.

# 2.3 Task Planning and Execution Control: Evolution and Advances

Effective research requires sophisticated planning and execution mechanisms to coordinate complex, multi-
stage workflows.

2.3.1 Research Task Planning Development. The ability to decompose research objectives into manageable
tasks represents a fundamental advancement:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early approaches employed simple task decomposition with linear ex-
ecution flows, similar to those found in early agent frameworks like MetaGPT [111] and AgentGPT [230].
Modern systems implement hierarchical planning with dynamic refinement based on intermediate results and
discoveries. Advanced planning approaches increasingly incorporate structured exploration methodologies
to navigate complex solution spaces efficiently. AIDE [120] demonstrates how tree search algorithms can

[PAGE 12]
12 Xu et al.

effectively explore the space of potential code solutions for machine learning engineering, trading computa-
tional resources for enhanced performance through strategic reuse and refinement of promising pathways.
Advanced implementations incorporate resource-aware planning, considering time constraints, computational
limitations, and information availability. However, incorporating AI tools for tasks like automated code
review has been observed to increase pull request closure durations despite benefits, as evidenced in studies
such as Cihan et al. [59], highlighting the critical need to account for temporal impacts in such resource-aware
systems. This evolution has enabled increasingly sophisticated research strategies adaptive to both task
requirements and available resources.

Representative Systems. The OpenAI/AgentsSDK [199] provides a comprehensive framework for research
task planning, with explicit support for goal decomposition, execution tracking, and adaptive refinement.
It enables the development of applications with sophisticated planning capabilities for research workflows.
Similarly, Flowith/OracleMode [77] implements specialized planning mechanisms optimized for research
tasks, with particular emphasis on information quality assessment and source prioritization. These systems
demonstrate how advanced planning capabilities can significantly improve research efficiency and effectiveness.

2.3.2 Autonomous Execution and Monitoring Advances. Reliable execution of research plans requires sophisti-
cated control and monitoring mechanisms:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Initial systems employed basic sequential execution with limited error
handling. Current implementations feature concurrent execution paths, comprehensive monitoring, and
dynamic response to execution challenges. Advanced systems implement self-supervision with explicit success
criteria, failure detection, and autonomous recovery strategies. This evolution has dramatically improved
the reliability and autonomy of Deep Research systems across complex tasks.

Representative Systems. Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] exemplifies advanced execution control through its rein-
forcement learning-based approach to research execution. The system learns effective execution strategies
from experience, continuously improving its ability to navigate complex research workflows. Its adaptive exe-
cution mechanisms can recover from failures and adjust strategies based on intermediate results, highlighting
how sophisticated control mechanisms can enhance research reliability and effectiveness.

2.3.3 Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework Development. Complex research often benefits from specialized
agent roles and collaborative approaches:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early systems relied on monolithic agents with undifferentiated capa-
bilities. Modern implementations employ specialized agent roles with explicit coordination mechanisms
and information sharing protocols. Advanced systems feature dynamic role allocation, consensus-building
mechanisms, and sophisticated conflict resolution strategies. This evolution has enabled increasingly complex
collaborative research workflows and improved performance on challenging tasks[49]. For instance, frame-
works employing multi-agent debate have been shown to improve evaluation consistency [48], while research
into generative AI voting demonstrates resilience to model biases in collective decision-making [162].

Representative Systems. The smolagents/open_deep_research [115] framework demonstrates effective
multi-agent collaboration through its modular agent architecture and explicit coordination mechanisms. It

[PAGE 13]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 13

enables the composition of specialized research teams with complementary capabilities and shared objectives.
Similarly, TARS [39] implements a sophisticated agent collaboration framework within its desktop environment,
allowing multiple specialized agents to contribute to unified research workflows. These systems highlight
how multi-agent approaches can enhance research capabilities through specialization and collaboration.

# 2.4 Knowledge Synthesis and Output Generation: Evolution and Advances

The ultimate value of Deep Research systems lies in their ability to synthesize disparate information into
coherent, actionable insights.

2.4.1 Information Evaluation Technology Development. Critical assessment of information quality represents
a crucial capability for reliable research:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early systems relied primarily on source reputation heuristics with limited
content-based assessment. Modern implementations employ sophisticated evaluation frameworks considering
source characteristics, content features, and consistency with established knowledge. Advanced systems
implement explicit uncertainty modeling, contradiction detection, and evidential reasoning approaches. This
evolution has dramatically improved the reliability and trustworthiness of research outputs. Advances in
knowledge retrieval based on generative AI enhance the ability to source and verify information [306].

Representative Systems. The grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] implements sophisticated information
evaluation mechanisms with explicit quality scoring for diverse source types. It can assess information
reliability based on both intrinsic content features and extrinsic source characteristics, enabling more
discerning information utilization. These capabilities highlight how advanced evaluation mechanisms can
significantly enhance research quality and reliability.

2.4.2 Report Generation Technology Advances. Effective communication of research findings requires sophis-
ticated content organization and presentation:

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Initial systems produced simple text summaries with limited structure or
coherence. Current implementations generate comprehensive reports with hierarchical organization, evidence
integration, and coherent argumentation. Advanced systems produce adaptive outputs tailored to audience
expertise, information needs, and presentation contexts. This evolution has dramatically improved the
usability and impact of Deep Research outputs.

Representative Systems. The mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249] project exemplifies advanced report
generation through its structured output framework and evidence integration mechanisms. It produces
comprehensive research reports with explicit attribution, structured arguments, and integrated supporting
evidence. These capabilities demonstrate how sophisticated report generation can enhance the utility and
trustworthiness of Deep Research outputs. Additionally, the MegaWika dataset [22] offers a large-scale
multilingual resource consisting of millions of articles and referenced sources, enabling collaborative AI
report generation.

2.4.3 Interactive Presentation Technology Development. Beyond static reports, interactive result exploration
enhances insight discovery and utilization:

[PAGE 14]
14 Xu et al.

Technical Evolution Trajectory. Early systems produced fixed textual outputs with minimal user interaction.
Modern implementations support dynamic exploration including drill-down capabilities, source verification,
and alternative viewpoint examination. Advanced systems enable collaborative refinement through iterative
feedback incorporation and adaptive response to user queries. This evolution has dramatically enhanced the
utility and flexibility of Deep Research interfaces.

Representative Systems. HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] implements sophisticated interactive presenta-
tion capabilities, allowing users to explore research findings through dynamic interfaces, examine supporting
evidence, and refine analysis through iterative interaction. These features highlight how interactive presen-
tation technologies can enhance the utility and accessibility of Deep Research outputs, facilitating more
effective knowledge transfer and utilization.
This technical framework provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding the capabilities and
evolution of Deep Research systems. The subsequent sections will build on this framework to analyze
implementation approaches, evaluate system performance, and explore applications across diverse domains.

3 Comparative Analysis and Evaluation of Deep Research Systems

Building upon the technical framework established in Section 2, this section provides a comprehensive
comparative analysis of existing Deep Research systems across multiple dimensions. We examine how different
implementations balance technical capabilities, application suitability, and performance characteristics to
address diverse research needs.

# 3.1 Cross-Dimensional Technical Comparison

Deep Research systems demonstrate varying strengths across the four key technical dimensions identified
in our framework. This section analyzes how different implementations balance these capabilities and the
resulting performance implications.

3.1.1 Foundation Model and Reasoning Efficiency Comparison. The underlying reasoning capabilities of Deep
Research systems significantly impact their overall effectiveness:

Table 1. Comparison of Foundation Model Characteristics

DOM: Depends On the Model

Commercial systems from OpenAI and Google leverage proprietary models with extensive context windows
and sophisticated reasoning mechanisms, enabling them to process larger volumes of information with greater
coherence. OpenAI’s o3 model demonstrates particular strength in complex reasoning tasks, while Gemini 2.5
Pro excels in information integration across diverse sources. In contrast, Perplexity/DeepResearch achieves

[PAGE 15]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 15

competitive performance with the open-source DeepSeek-R1 model through optimized implementation and
focused use cases.
Open-source implementations like Camel-AI/OWL [43] and QwenLM/Qwen-Agent [224] demonstrate that
effective deep research capabilities can be achieved with more accessible models through specialized opti-
mization. The open-weight approach of Camel-AI/OWL [43] enables flexible deployment across computing
environments, while [224] leverages modular reasoning to compensate for more limited
QwenLM/Qwen-Agent
base model capabilities.

3.1.2 Tool Integration and Environmental Adaptability Comparison. The ability to interact with diverse
information environments varies significantly across implementations:

Table 2. Environmental Interaction Capabilities of Deep Research Systems

Specialized tools like Nanobrowser [184] excel in web interaction capabilities, providing sophisticated
navigation and content extraction optimized for research workflows. Systems like dzhng/deep-research
[321] and nickscamara/open-deep-research [42] complement these capabilities with advanced document
processing features that can extract structured information from diverse formats.
Comprehensive platforms like Manus [164] and AutoGLM [330] offer broader environmental interaction
capabilities, balancing web browsing, API integration, and document processing. These systems can adapt
to diverse research scenarios but may not match the specialized performance of more focused tools in
specific domains. The workflow automation capabilities of n8n [183] provide exceptional flexibility for API
integration but offer more limited direct interaction with web and document environments.

3.1.3 Task Planning and Execution Stability Comparison. Effective research requires reliable task planning
and execution capabilities:

Table 3. Planning and Execution Capabilities of Deep Research Systems

The OpenAI/AgentsSDK [199] demonstrates sophisticated planning capabilities with hierarchical task
decomposition and adaptive execution, enabling complex research workflows with reliable completion rates.
Similarly, Flowith/OracleMode [77] offers advanced planning mechanisms optimized for research tasks,
though with more limited error recovery capabilities.

[PAGE 16]
16 Xu et al.

Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] employs reinforcement learning techniques to develop robust execution strategies,
enabling exceptional error recovery capabilities that can adapt to unexpected challenges during research work-
flows. In contrast, smolagents/open_deep_research [115] and TARS [39] focus on multi-agent collaboration,
distributing complex tasks across specialized agents to enhance overall research effectiveness.
Simpler implementations like grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] offer more limited planning and
execution capabilities but may provide sufficient reliability for less complex research tasks, demonstrating
the range of complexity available across the ecosystem.

3.1.4 Knowledge Synthesis and Output Quality Comparison. The ability to synthesize findings into coherent,
reliable outputs varies significantly:

Table 4. Knowledge Synthesis Capabilities of Deep Research Systems

Commercial platforms like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] demonstrate
sophisticated information evaluation capabilities, effectively assessing source credibility and content reliability
to produce high-quality syntheses. OpenAI’s implementation excels in report structure and organization,
while Perplexity offers particularly strong citation practices for source attribution and verification.
Open-source implementations like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249] focus on report structure and
organization, producing well-formatted outputs that effectively communicate research findings. HKUDS/Auto-
Deep-Research [112] emphasizes interactive exploration, allowing users to examine evidence and refine
analyses through iterative interaction. Specialized tools like grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] prioritize
information evaluation over presentation, focusing on reliable content assessment rather than sophisticated
output formatting.

# 3.2 Application-Based System Suitability Analysis

Beyond technical capabilities, Deep Research systems demonstrate varying suitability for different application
contexts. This section examines how system characteristics align with key application domains.

3.2.1 Academic Research Scenario Adaptability Assessment. Academic research requires particular empha-
sis on comprehensive literature review, methodological rigor, and citation quality. Systems like OpenAI/
DeepResearch [197] excel in this domain through their ability to access academic databases, comprehensively
analyze research methodologies, and generate properly formatted citations. Other specialized academic
research tools like PaperQA [80] and Scite [243] offer complementary capabilities focused specifically on
scientific literature processing, while Google’s NotebookLm [95] provides structured knowledge workspaces
for academic exploration.
OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] demonstrates exceptional suitability for academic research through its com-
prehensive literature coverage, methodological rigor, and high-quality citation practices. The system can
effectively navigate academic databases, understand research methodologies, and produce well-structured

literature reviews with appropriate attribution. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] offers similarly strong
performance for literature coverage and citation quality, though with somewhat less methodological sophisti-
cation.
Open-source alternatives like Camel-AI/OWL [43] provide competitive capabilities for specific academic
domains, particular strength in methodological understanding for specific domains. Systems like dzhng/deep-
research [321], mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249], and HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] offer moderate
capabilities across all dimensions, making them suitable for less demanding academic research applications
or preliminary literature exploration.

3.2.2 Enterprise Decision-Making Scenario Adaptability Assessment. Business intelligence and strategic
decision-making emphasize information currency, analytical depth, and actionable insights:

Table 6. Enterprise Decision-Making Application Features of Deep Research Systems

Gemini/DeepResearch [60] demonstrates exceptional suitability for enterprise decision-making through its
strong information currency, analytical capabilities, and actionable output formats. The system effectively
navigates business information sources, analyzes market trends, and produces insights directly relevant to
decision processes. Manus [164] offers similarly strong performance for information acquisition and analysis,
though with somewhat less emphasis on actionable recommendation formatting. Microsoft Copilot [173]
empowers organizations with powerful generative AI, enterprise-grade security and privacy, and is trusted
by companies around the world. Similarly, the Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant [181] employs
knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation to accurately respond over private enterprise
documents, significantly enhancing response relevance while maintaining provenance tracking.
Workflow automation platforms like n8n [183] provide particular strengths in information currency
and actionability through their integration with enterprise data sources and business intelligence tools.
Research-focused systems like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] and Flowith/OracleMode [77] offer competitive an-
alytical capabilities but may require additional processing to translate findings into actionable business
recommendations.

3.2.3 Personal Knowledge Management Adaptability Assessment. Individual knowledge management empha-
sizes accessibility, personalization, and integration with existing workflows:

Table 7. Personal Knowledge Management Features of Deep Research Systems

Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] offers strong accessibility for personal knowledge management through
its consumer-friendly interface and free access tier, though with more limited personalization capabilities.
Open-source implementations like nickscamara/open-deep-research [42] and OpenManus [193] provide
greater personalization possibilities through local deployment and customization, enabling adaptation to
individual information management preferences.
Infrastructure tools like Nanobrowser [184] and Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch [121] offer particular strengths
in workflow integration, allowing seamless incorporation into existing personal knowledge management
systems and processes. More complex frameworks like smolagents/open_deep_research [115] provide
sophisticated capabilities but may present accessibility challenges for non-technical users.

3.3 Performance Metrics and Benchmarking
Beyond qualitative comparisons, quantitative performance metrics provide objective assessment of Deep
Research capabilities across systems.

3.3.1 Quantitative Evaluation Metrics. Standard benchmarks enable comparative evaluation of core research
capabilities:

OpenAI/DeepResearch [30, 123, 197] demonstrates leading performance across various benchmark cate-
gories, particularly excelling in Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) [212] hich measures advanced research and
reasoning capabilities. Gemini/DeepResearch [60] shows comparable performance. According to the intro-
duction of Google Deep Research with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental [60, 126], the new model demonstrated
superior user preference over OpenAI/DeepResearch across four key metrics: instruction following (60.6% vs.
39.4%), Comprehensiveness (76.9% vs. 23.1%), Completeness (73.3% vs. 26.7%), and Writing quality (58.2%
vs. 41.8%). These results suggest Gemini 2.5 Pro’s enhanced capability in synthesizing structured, high-fidelity
research outputs. This capability is further amplified in fullstack applications, where the integration of Gemini

models with frameworks like LangGraph facilitates research-augmented conversational AI for comprehen-
sive query handling, as demonstrated in Google-Gemini/Gemini-Fullstack-Langgraph-Quickstart [94].
Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] achieves competitive results despite utilizing the open-source DeepSeek-R1
model, highlighting the importance of implementation quality beyond raw model capabilities.
Open-source implementations show progressively lower benchmark scores, though many still achieve
respectable performance suitable for practical applications. Systems like AutoGLM-Research [330], HKUDS/
Auto-Deep-Research [112], and Camel-AI/OWL [43] demonstrate that effective research capabilities can be
achieved with more accessible models and frameworks, though with some performance trade-offs compared
to leading commercial implementations.
Recent benchmark development has expanded evaluation to more specialized aspects of research assis-
tance. The AAAR-1.0 benchmark [157] specifically evaluates AI’s potential to assist research through 150
multi-domain tasks designed to test both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Domain-specific approaches
include DSBench [122], which evaluates data science agent capabilities across 20 real-world tasks[182, 283],
SciCode [268] for scientific code generation, MASSW [323] for scientific workflow assistance, and MMSci [147]
for multimodal scientific understanding across graduate-level materials. ScienceQA[160] offers a comprehen-
sive multimodal science benchmark with chain-of-thought explanations for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
Domain-specific benchmarks like TPBench [58] for theoretical physics and AAAR-1.0 [157] for research
assistance capabilities offer additional targeted evaluation approaches for specialized research applications.
Multi-domain code generation benchmark like DomainCodeBench[328] is designed to systematically assess
large language models across 12 software application domains and 15 programming languages. Interactive
evaluation frameworks like LatEval [114] specifically assess systems’ capabilities in handling incomplete
information through lateral thinking puzzles, providing insight into research abilities under uncertainty and
ambiguity. Complementary approaches like Mask-DPO [100] focus on generalizable fine-grained factuality
alignment, addressing a critical requirement for reliable research outputs. Domain-specific benchmarks such
as GMAI-MMBench [51] provide comprehensive multimodal evaluation frameworks specifically designed for
medical AI applications, while AutoBench [52] offers automated evaluation of scientific discovery capabilities,
providing standardized assessment of core research functions. Other broad evaluation frameworks including
HELM [149], BIG-bench [88], and AGIEval [331], provide complementary assessment dimensions. Specialized

3.3.2 Qualitative Assessment Frameworks. Beyond numeric benchmarks, qualitative evaluation provides
insight into practical effectiveness:

Table 11. Documented Output Characteristics of Deep Research Systems

Commercial systems generally demonstrate stronger qualitative performance, particularly in output
coherence and factual accuracy. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] produces exceptionally well-structured reports

with reliable factual content, while also achieving moderate innovation in connecting disparate sources.
[60] shows similar strengths in coherence and accuracy, with slightly less emphasis
Gemini/DeepResearch
on novel insights.

Some open-source implementations show particular strengths in specific dimensions. Agent-RL/ReSearch
[2] achieves notable performance in insight novelty through its exploration-focused approach, while grapeot/

deep_research_agent [263] demonstrates strong factual accuracy through its emphasis on information
verification. These specialized capabilities highlight the diversity of approaches within the Deep Research

ecosystem.

3.3.3 Efficiency and Resource Utilization Metrics. Practical deployment considerations include computational
requirements and operational efficiency:

Commercial cloud-based services offer optimized performance with moderate response times, though
with dependency on external infrastructure and associated costs. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] achieves

particularly strong efficiency metrics, with relatively quick response times and high token efficiency despite

its competitive output quality.
Open-source implementations present greater variability in efficiency metrics. Systems like AutoGLM-

Research [330] and QwenLM/Qwen-Agent [224] require substantial computational resources but can be
deployed in local environments, offering greater control and potential cost savings for high-volume usage.

This comparative analysis highlights the diversity of approaches and capabilities across the Deep Research
ecosystem. While commercial implementations currently demonstrate leading performance on standard
benchmarks, open-source alternatives offer competitive capabilities in specific domains and use cases, with
particular advantages in customization, control, and potential cost efficiency for specialized applications.
The subsequent sections will build on this analysis to examine implementation technologies, evaluation
methodologies, and application domains in greater detail.

4 Implementation Technologies and Challenges

The practical realization of Deep Research systems involves numerous technical challenges spanning in-
frastructure design, system integration, and safeguard implementation. This section examines the key
implementation technologies that enable effective Deep Research capabilities and the challenges that must
be addressed for reliable, efficient operation.

# 4.1 Architectural Implementation Patterns
## 4.1 Architectural Implementation Patterns (part 1)

4.1 Architectural Implementation Patterns

The diverse systems analyzed in this survey reveal several distinct architectural patterns that represent
different approaches to implementing Deep Research capabilities. This section examines four fundamental
architectural patterns: monolithic, pipeline-based, multi-agent, and hybrid implementations. For each pattern,
we analyze the underlying structural principles, component interactions, information flow mechanisms, and
representative systems.

4.1.1 Monolithic Architecture Pattern. Monolithic implementations integrate all Deep Research capabilities
within a unified architectural framework centered around a core reasoning engine. As illustrated in Figure 4,
these systems employ a centralized control mechanism with direct integration of specialized modules.
The defining characteristics of this architecture include:
∙ Centralized Control Flow: All operations route through a primary reasoning engine that maintains
global state and execution context
∙ Tightly Coupled Integration: Specialized modules (web browsing, document processing, etc.) are
directly integrated with the central controller
∙ Shared Memory Architecture: Information state is maintained in a centralized memory system
accessible to all components

[PAGE 22]
22 Xu et al.

Implementation Architecture of Deep Research Systems

Fig. 3. Implementation Architecture of Deep Research Systems

∙ Sequential Reasoning Processes: Operations typically follow a structured sequence defined by the
central controller

This architectural pattern offers strong coherence and reasoning consistency through its unified control
structure. However, it presents challenges for extensibility and can struggle with parallelization of com-
plex operations. Representative implementations include OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and grapeot/deep_
research_agent [263], which demonstrate how this architecture enables coherent reasoning across diverse
information sources while maintaining implementation simplicity.

4.1.2 Pipeline-Based Architecture Pattern. Pipeline architectures implement Deep Research capabilities
through a sequence of specialized processing stages connected through well-defined interfaces. As shown in
Figure 5, these systems decompose research workflows into discrete processing components with explicit
data transformations between stages.
The key characteristics of pipeline implementations include:

∙ Sequential Component Organization: Research tasks flow through a predefined sequence of specialized
processing modules
∙ Standardized Interfaces: Clear data transformation specifications between pipeline stages enable
modular component replacement
∙ Staged Processing Logic: Each component implements a specific transformation, with minimal
dependence on global state
∙ Configurable Workflow Paths: Advanced implementations enable conditional routing between alter-
native processing paths based on intermediary results

Pipeline architectures excel in workflow customization and component reusability but may struggle
with complex reasoning tasks requiring iterative refinement across components. Systems like [183]
n8n
and dzhng/deep-research [321] exemplify this approach, demonstrating how explicit workflow sequencing
enables sophisticated research automation through composition of specialized components.

4.1.3 Multi-Agent Architecture Pattern. Multi-agent architectures implement Deep Research capabilities
through ecosystems of specialized autonomous agents coordinated through explicit communication protocols.
Figure 6 illustrates how these systems distribute research functionality across collaborating agents with
differentiated roles and responsibilities.

Fig. 5. Pipeline-Based Deep Research Architecture

The defining elements of multi-agent implementations include:

∙ Distributed Functional Decomposition: Research capabilities are distributed across specialized agents
with defined roles (searcher, analyst, critic, etc.)
∙ Explicit Coordination Mechanisms: Standardized message passing and task delegation protocols
enable inter-agent collaboration
∙ Autonomous Decision Logic: Individual agents maintain independent reasoning capabilities within
their designated domains
∙ Dynamic Task Allocation: Advanced implementations employ flexible task assignment based on agent
capabilities and current workload

Multi-agent architectures excel in complex research tasks requiring diverse specialized capabilities and
parallel processing. Their distributed nature enables exceptional scaling for complex research workflows but
introduces challenges in maintaining overall coherence and consistent reasoning across agents. Representative
implementations include smolagents/open_deep_research [115] and TARS [39], which demonstrate how
multi-agent coordination enables sophisticated research workflows through specialized agent collaboration.

4.1.4 Hybrid Architecture Pattern. Hybrid architectures combine elements from multiple architectural
patterns to balance their respective advantages within unified implementations. As shown in Figure 7, these
systems employ strategic integration of architectural approaches to address specific research requirements.
Key characteristics of hybrid implementations include:

∙ Tiered Architectural Organization: Different architectural patterns are employed at different system
levels based on functional requirements
∙ Domain-Specific Optimization: Architectural approaches are selected based on domain-specific pro-
cessing requirements
∙ Flexible Integration Mechanisms: Standardized interfaces enable communication between components
employing different architectural patterns
∙ Adaptive Execution Frameworks: Control mechanisms dynamically adjust processing approaches
based on task characteristics

Hybrid architectures offer exceptional flexibility and optimization opportunities but introduce implemen-
tation complexity and potential integration challenges. Systems like Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] and
Camel-AI/OWL [43] exemplify this approach, combining centralized reasoning with distributed information

gathering and specialized processing pipelines to achieve sophisticated research capabilities with balanced
performance characteristics.

## 4.1 Architectural Implementation Patterns (part 2)

4.1.5 Emerging Agent Framework Ecosystems. Beyond the core architectural patterns described above, the
Deep Research ecosystem has been significantly enhanced by specialized agent frameworks that provide
standardized components for agent development. Emerging systems incorporate specialized agent frameworks
[54, 142, 301] that structure reasoning in ways particularly suited to complex research tasks requiring both
depth and breadth of analysis. As detailed in comprehensive analyses of agent frameworks [133, 304], these
systems offer varying approaches to agent orchestration, execution control, and reasoning orchestration.
Key frameworks include LangGraph [134], which provides graph-based control flow for language model
applications, enabling complex reasoning patterns through explicit state management and transition logic.
Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) [91] offers a comprehensive framework for agent development with
standardized interfaces for tool integration, planning, and execution monitoring. CrewAI [64] implements an
agent collaboration framework designed specifically for multi-specialist workflows, enabling role-based task
distribution with explicit coordination mechanisms. More experimental frameworks like Agno [3] explore
agentic autonomy through self-improvement and meta-reasoning capabilities.

[PAGE 27]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 27

The TapeAgents framework [19] provides a particularly comprehensive approach to agent development
and optimization, with explicit support for iterative refinement through systematic recording and analysis
of agent behavior. These frameworks collectively demonstrate an ongoing shift toward standardized agent
components that enhance development efficiency while enabling more complex reasoning and execution
patterns.

4.1.6 Architectural Pattern Comparison. Table 13 provides a comparative analysis of these architectural
patterns across key performance dimensions:

Table 13. Architectural Pattern Characteristics in Deep Research Systems

Each architectural pattern presents distinct advantages and limitations that influence its suitability for
specific Deep Research applications. Monolithic architectures excel in reasoning coherence and implemen-
tation simplicity, making them appropriate for focused research applications with well-defined workflows.
Pipeline architectures offer exceptional extensibility and component reusability, enabling customized research
workflows through modular composition. Multi-agent architectures provide superior parallelization and fault
tolerance, supporting complex research tasks requiring diverse specialized capabilities. Hybrid architectures
balance these characteristics through strategic integration, offering flexible optimization for diverse research
requirements.
The architectural pattern selection significantly influences system capabilities, performance characteristics,
and application suitability. As the Deep Research ecosystem continues to evolve, we anticipate further
architectural innovation combining elements from these foundational patterns to address emerging application
requirements and technical capabilities.

# 4.2 Infrastructure and Computational Optimization

Deep Research systems require sophisticated infrastructure to support their complex reasoning and informa-
tion processing capabilities.

4.2.1 Distributed Reasoning Architectures. Effective reasoning across expansive information landscapes
requires specialized architectural approaches. Frameworks like AutoChain [78] and AutoGen [298] have
pioneered distributed agent paradigms that can be applied to research workflows. Advanced systems
employ distributed reasoning architectures that decompose complex queries into parallel processing paths.
OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] implements a hierarchical reasoning framework that distributes analytical tasks
across multiple execution threads while maintaining coherent central coordination.
Implementation approaches increasingly leverage specialized frameworks for efficient LLM serving, in-
cluding LightLLM [177], Ollama [192], VLLM [281], and Web-LLM [176] for browser-based deployment.

[PAGE 28]
28 Xu et al.

These frameworks enable more efficient utilization of computational resources, particularly important for
resource-intensive research workflows requiring extensive model inference. Such optimizations are especially
critical for open-source implementations operating with more constrained computational resources compared
to commercial cloud-based alternatives.

Parallel Reasoning Pathways. Advanced systems employ distributed reasoning architectures that decom-
pose complex queries into parallel processing paths. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] implements a hierarchical
reasoning framework that distributes analytical tasks across multiple execution threads while maintaining
coherent central coordination. Similar approaches are evident in Gemini/DeepResearch [60], which leverages
Google’s distributed computing infrastructure to parallelize information analysis while preserving reasoning
consistency.
Open-source implementations like HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] and Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] demon-
strate more accessible distributed reasoning approaches, utilizing task decomposition and asynchronous
processing to enhance performance within more constrained computational environments. These systems
show that effective parallelization can be achieved even without the extensive infrastructure of commercial
platforms.

Memory and State Management. Distributed reasoning introduces significant challenges in memory coher-
ence and state management. Commercial systems implement sophisticated state synchronization mechanisms
that maintain consistent reasoning contexts across distributed components. OpenAI’s implementation utilizes
a hierarchical memory architecture with explicit coordination protocols [200], while Google’s approach
leverages its existing distributed computing frameworks adapted for reasoning workflows.
Open-source alternatives like Camel-AI/OWL [43] employ simplified but effective memory management
approaches, including centralized knowledge repositories with controlled access patterns. These implementa-
tions demonstrate pragmatic solutions to state management challenges within more constrained technical
environments.

4.2.2 Parallel Search and Information Retrieval. Information acquisition represents a primary bottleneck in
Deep Research performance:

Concurrent Query Execution. Advanced systems implement sophisticated parallel search infrastructures
to accelerate information gathering. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] employs a multi-threaded search
architecture that dispatches dozens of concurrent queries across different information sources, significantly
accelerating the research process. Similar capabilities are evident in dzhng/deep-research [321], which
implements a specialized scheduler for concurrent web queries with adaptive rate limiting to avoid service
restrictions.
Infrastructure tools like Nanobrowser [184] provide optimized platforms for parallel browsing operations,
enabling multiple concurrent page loads with shared resource management. These specialized components en-
hance the information gathering capabilities of integrated systems like Manus [164] and Flowith/OracleMode
[77], which leverage concurrent browsing to accelerate their research workflows.

Query Coordination and Deduplication. Effective parallel search requires sophisticated coordination to
avoid redundancy and ensure comprehensive coverage. Commercial systems implement advanced query

[PAGE 29]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 29

planning that dynamically adapts to intermediate results, adjusting search strategies based on discovered
information. OpenAI’s implementation includes explicit deduplication mechanisms that identify and con-
solidate redundant sources, while Perplexity employs source diversification techniques to ensure broad
coverage.
Open-source tools like nickscamara/open-deep-research [42] implement pragmatic approaches to query
coordination, including simple but effective caching mechanisms and result fingerprinting to avoid redundant
processing. These techniques demonstrate that effective coordination can be achieved with relatively
straightforward implementation approaches.

4.2.3 Resource Allocation and Efficiency Optimization. Computational efficiency significantly impacts both
performance and operational economics:

Adaptive Resource Allocation. Advanced systems implement dynamic resource allocation based on task
characteristics and complexity. Gemini/DeepResearch [60] employs sophisticated workload prediction to
provision computational resources adaptively, allocating additional capacity for more complex research
tasks. Similar approaches are emerging in open-source implementations like QwenLM/Qwen-Agent [224], which
incorporates task complexity estimation to guide resource allocation decisions.

Progressive Processing Strategies. Efficiency-focused implementations employ progressive processing ap-
proaches that incrementally refine results based on available information. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209]
utilizes a staged analysis approach that provides preliminary findings quickly while continuing deeper analysis
in the background. This strategy enhances perceived responsiveness while ensuring comprehensive results
for complex queries.
Open-source alternatives like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249] implement simpler but effective pro-
gressive strategies, including early result previews and incremental report generation. These approaches
demonstrate pragmatic solutions to efficiency challenges without requiring sophisticated infrastructure.

# 4.3 System Integration and Interoperability
## 4.3 System Integration and Interoperability (part 1)

4.3 System Integration and Interoperability

Deep Research systems must effectively coordinate diverse components and external services to deliver
comprehensive capabilities.

4.3.1 API Design and Standardization. Consistent interfaces enable modular development and component
interoperability:

Component Interface Standardization. Current Deep Research implementations employ largely incom-
patible architectures and interfaces. Future research could build upon emerging standardization efforts
like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) [12] and Google’s Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) [90, 92]
to establish truly universal component interfaces. MCP provides a structured framework for model-tool
interaction, enabling consistent integration patterns across diverse LLM applications, while A2A focuses
on standardized agent-to-agent communication to facilitate multi-agent systems. These complementary
approaches could form the foundation for comprehensive standardization enabling modular development

[PAGE 30]
30 Xu et al.

and interchangeable components across implementations. Early steps in this direction appear in frame-
works like OpenAI/AgentsSDK [199], which provides standardized agent definitions, but more comprehensive
standardization would require broader industry adoption of common protocols.

Workflow Automation. Several workflow automation platforms like Dify [259], Coze [38], and Flowise
[5] have emerged as low-code environments for building LLM-powered applications, potentially offering
standardized frameworks for Deep Research components. Advanced workflow orchestration platforms
including Temporal [265], Restate [229], and Orkes [203] provide robust infrastructure for complex, stateful
workflows with explicit support for long-running processes and reliability patterns crucial for sophisticated
research applications. Implementation approaches might include defining standard message passing protocols
between research components, establishing common data structures for research tasks and results, developing
compatibility layers between competing standards, extending existing protocols with research-specific
interaction patterns, and establishing common evaluation frameworks for component interoperability. These
advances could accelerate ecosystem development by enabling specialized components from diverse developers
to work seamlessly within unified frameworks, significantly enhancing the pace of innovation through
componentization and reuse.

External Service Integration. Access to specialized external services significantly enhances research capa-
bilities. Advanced retrieval frameworks like LlamaIndex [235] provide standardized interfaces for retrieval
augmentation, enabling consistent integration patterns across diverse information sources and document
formats. Systems like n8n [183] excel in external service integration through their comprehensive connector
library and standardized authentication mechanisms. This capability enables access to specialized information
sources and analytical services that extend beyond basic web search.
Open-source frameworks like Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch [121] implement simplified but effective API
integration patterns, providing standardized wrappers for common services while maintaining extensibility
for custom integrations. These approaches balance standardization with flexibility for diverse research
requirements.

4.3.2 Tool Integration Frameworks. Effective orchestration of diverse tools enhances overall system capabili-
ties:

Tool Selection and Composition. Advanced systems implement sophisticated tool selection based on
task requirements and information context. Manus [164] features an adaptive tool selection framework
that identifies appropriate tools for specific research subtasks, dynamically composing workflows based on
available capabilities. Similar approaches are emerging in open-source implementations like grapeot/deep_
research_agent [263], which includes basic tool selection heuristics based on task classification.

Tool Execution Monitoring. Reliable tool usage requires effective execution monitoring and error handling.
Commercial systems implement sophisticated monitoring frameworks that track tool execution, detect
failures, and implement recovery strategies. OpenAI’s implementation includes explicit success criteria
verification and fallback mechanisms for tool failures, ensuring reliable operation even with unreliable
external components.

[PAGE 31]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 31

Open implementations like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] demonstrate more accessible monitoring approaches,
including simplified execution tracking and basic retry mechanisms for common failure modes. These imple-
mentations show that effective monitoring can be achieved with relatively straightforward implementation
strategies.
Recent advances in agent collaboration frameworks [145, 221] highlight significant challenges in agent
coordination [46], particularly for complex research tasks requiring diverse, specialized capabilities working
in concert toward unified research objectives.

4.3.3 Cross-Platform Compatibility. Deployment flexibility requires careful attention to environmental de-
pendencies:

Platform Abstraction Layers. Cross-platform implementations employ abstraction layers to isolate core
logic from environmental dependencies. TARS [39] implements a sophisticated abstraction architecture that
separates its core reasoning framework from platform-specific integration components, enabling deployment
across diverse environments. Similar approaches are evident in Nanobrowser [184], which provides consistent
browsing capabilities across different operating systems.

Containerization and Deployment Standardization. Modern implementations leverage containerization to
ensure consistent deployment across environments. OpenManus [193] provides explicit container configurations
that encapsulate all dependencies, enabling reliable deployment across diverse infrastructures. Similar
approaches are employed by AutoGLM-Research [330], which provides standardized deployment configurations
for different environments. Alongside containerization, modern cloud platforms such as Vercel [280] offer
streamlined, standardized deployment workflows for the web-based interfaces of many research applications.

4.3.4 Research-Oriented Coding Assistance Integration. The integration of AI-powered coding assistants
represents an increasingly important dimension of Deep Research system capabilities, particularly for
computational research workflows requiring custom analysis scripts, data processing pipelines[108], and
research automation tools.

## 4.3 System Integration and Interoperability (part 2)

Coding Assistant Integration Patterns. Modern research workflows increasingly depend on custom code
development for data analysis, visualization, and automation tasks. AI coding assistants have emerged as
crucial tools for enhancing researcher productivity in these computational aspects. The landscape of coding
assistance tools demonstrates varying approaches to integration with research workflows, from IDE-native
completion systems to conversational code generation interfaces. Systems like GitHub Copilot [20, 86] provide
seamless integration within development environments, enabling context-aware code completion for research
scripts and analysis workflows. Complementary approaches like ChatGPT-based code generation [309] offer
conversational interfaces that can translate research requirements into executable implementations. More
specialized frameworks like AutoDev [275], DSPy[257], and Pydantic-AI[216] enable end-to-end automated
development workflows particularly suited for research prototype generation and experimental tool creation.
Additionally, tools like Bolt [32] allow researchers to create web applications directly from text descriptions,
handling the coding process while they focus on their vision. Evolutionary coding agents like AlphaEvolve [190]
further enhance capabilities by iteratively optimizing algorithms using autonomous pipelines of LLMs and
evolutionary feedback mechanisms. Recent research explores the synergy between generative AI and software

[PAGE 32]
32 Xu et al.

engineering, leveraging techniques like zero-shot prompting to enhance coding assistants and streamline
development processes [41]. However, research has revealed limitations in these assistants’ capabilities, such
as ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and a lack of credible evidence to support their responses
[35]. A large-scale survey demonstrates that developers frequently decline initial suggestions, citing unmet
functional or non-functional requirements and challenges in controlling the tool to generate desired outputs
[148]. User resistance behaviors documented in such surveys highlight the need for comprehensive adoption
strategies, including providing active support during initial use, clearly communicating system capabilities,
and adhering to predefined collaboration rules to mitigate low acceptance rates[252]. This underscores the
need for adaptive hint systems, which can provide personalized support for bug finding and fixing by tailoring
to user understanding levels and program representations to improve accuracy in debugging tasks [226].
Pioneering studies employ physiological measurements such as EEG and eye tracking to quantify developers’
cognitive load during AI-assisted programming tasks, addressing critical gaps in understanding actual usage
patterns and productivity impacts [106]. Furthermore, tools like CodeScribe address challenges in AI-driven
code translation for scientific computing by combining prompt engineering with user supervision to automate
conversion processes while ensuring correctness [69]. Similarly, CodeCompose’s multi-line suggestion feature
deployed at Meta demonstrates substantial productivity improvements, saving 17% of keystrokes through
optimized latency solutions despite initial usability challenges [72]. Moreover, for debugging tasks, ChatDBG
[139] enhances debugging capabilities by enabling programmers to engage in collaborative dialogues for root
cause analysis and bug resolution, leveraging LLMs to provide domain-specific reasoning. Intelligent QA
assistants are also being developed to streamline bug resolution processes [308], and grey literature reviews
indicate a growing trend in AI-assisted test automation [231]. Additionally, benchmarks like CodeMMLU [163]
evaluate code understanding and reasoning across diverse tasks, revealing significant comprehension gaps in
current models despite advanced generative capabilities. Empirical evaluations of ACATs through controlled
development scenarios demonstrate nuanced variations in acceptance patterns, modification reasons, and
effectiveness based on task characteristics and user expertise [260]. Generative AI tools significantly enhance
developer productivity by accelerating learning processes and altering collaborative team workflows through
reduced repetitive tasks, fundamentally transforming development paradigms [277]. To realize the vision of
next-generation AI coding assistants, it is crucial to address integration gaps and establish robust design
principles such as setting clear usage expectations and employing extendable backend architectures [186].

Table 14. Qualitative Assessment of AI Coding Assistants for Research Applications

The diversity of coding assistance approaches highlights the importance of integration flexibility within
Deep Research systems. While some implementations benefit from tightly integrated coding assistance
that understands research context, others require more flexible interfaces that can accommodate diverse

[PAGE 33]

development workflows and programming paradigms. This integration dimension becomes particularly
crucial as research increasingly requires custom computational tools and analysis pipelines that extend
beyond pre-existing software packages[75, 244, 295]. Recent work by Chen et al. [53] demonstrates that
proactive programming assistants, which automatically provide suggestions to enhance productivity and
user experience, represent a key advancement in this domain. Additionally, ChatDev [220] exemplifies how
linguistic communication serves as a unifying bridge for multi-agent collaboration in software development,
streamlining the entire lifecycle from design to testing. Moreover, research on integrating AI assistants in
Agile meetings reveals critical links to team collaboration dynamics and provides roadmaps for facilitating
their adoption in development contexts [40]. As demonstrated by Talissa Dreossi[70], this hybrid approach
bridges the gap between the high performance of deep learning models and the transparency of symbolic
reasoning, advancing AI by providing interpretable and trustworthy applications.

Research Workflow Code Generation. Advanced coding assistants specifically optimized for research
contexts demonstrate particular value in translating research methodologies into executable implementations.
Systems like GPT-Pilot [217] enable guided development of complete research applications, while domain-
specific tools can generate analysis scripts aligned with particular research methodologies or data types.
These capabilities enhance research efficiency by reducing the technical barriers between research design and
computational implementation.
Implementation patterns typically involve integration with research data management systems, version
control workflows, and collaborative development environments that support reproducible research practices.
The effectiveness of such integration depends significantly on the coding assistant’s understanding of research-
specific requirements including documentation standards, reproducibility considerations, and domain-specific
libraries and frameworks commonly used in particular research fields[124].

# 4.4 Technical Challenges and Solutions

Deep Research systems face numerous technical challenges that must be addressed for reliable, trustworthy
operation.

4.4.1 Hallucination Control and Factual Consistency. Maintaining factual accuracy represents a fundamental
challenge for LLM-based research systems:

Source Grounding Techniques. Advanced implementations employ explicit source grounding to enhance
factual reliability. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] implements strict attribution requirements that link all
generated content to specific sources, reducing unsupported assertions. Similar approaches are evident in
OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], which maintains explicit provenance tracking throughout the reasoning process.
Open-source implementations like grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] demonstrate more accessible
grounding approaches, including simple but effective citation tracking and verification mechanisms. These
techniques show that meaningful improvements in factual reliability can be achieved with straightforward
implementation strategies.

Contradiction Detection and Resolution. Effective research requires identification and resolution of contra-
dictory information. Commercial systems implement sophisticated contradiction detection mechanisms that
identify inconsistencies between sources and implement resolution strategies [296]. Gemini/DeepResearch

[PAGE 34]
34 Xu et al.

[60] includes explicit uncertainty modeling and conflicting evidence presentation, enhancing transparency
when definitive conclusions cannot be reached.
Open implementations like HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] employ simpler but useful contradiction iden-
tification approaches, flagging potential inconsistencies for user review. These implementations demonstrate
that even basic contradiction handling can significantly enhance research reliability.

4.4.2 Privacy Protection and Security Design. Research systems must safeguard sensitive information and
protect against potential misuse:

Query and Result Isolation. Secure implementations employ strict isolation between user queries to
prevent information leakage. Commercial platforms implement sophisticated tenant isolation that ensures
complete separation between different users’ research activities. Similar concerns motivate open-source
implementations like OpenManus [193], which enables local deployment for sensitive research applications.

Source Data Protection. Responsible implementation requires careful handling of source information.
Systems like Flowith/OracleMode [77] implement controlled data access patterns that respect source restric-
tions including authentication requirements and access limitations. These approaches enhance compliance
with source terms of service while ensuring comprehensive information access. Recent advancements include
benchmarking frameworks such as CI-Bench [56], which evaluates how well systems adhere to contextual
norms and privacy expectations.

4.4.3 Explainability and Transparency. The scientific context places particularly stringent requirements on
explanation quality. Mengaldo [170] argues that transparent explanation is not merely a feature but a
fundamental requirement for scientific applications, emphasizing that black-box approaches fundamentally
contradict scientific methodology’s requirement for transparent reasoning and reproducible results. This
perspective suggests that explanation capabilities may require different standards in scientific Deep Research
applications compared to general AI systems. Trustworthy research systems must provide insight into their
reasoning processes and sources:

Reasoning Trail Documentation. Advanced implementations maintain explicit documentation of the
reasoning process. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] includes comprehensive reasoning traces that expose the
analytical steps leading to specific conclusions. Similar capabilities are emerging in open-source alternatives
like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249], which includes basic reasoning documentation to enhance result
interpretability.

Source Attribution and Verification. Transparent systems provide clear attribution for all information
and enable verification. [209] implements comprehensive citation practices with
Perplexity/DeepResearch
explicit links to original sources, enabling direct verification of all claims. Similar approaches are employed
by dzhng/deep-research [321], which maintains rigorous source tracking throughout the research process.
These implementation technologies and challenges highlight the complex engineering considerations
involved in creating effective Deep Research systems. While commercial platforms benefit from extensive
infrastructure and specialized components, open-source implementations demonstrate that effective research
capabilities can be achieved through pragmatic approaches to the same fundamental challenges. The diversity

[PAGE 35]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 35

of implementation strategies across the ecosystem reflects different priorities in balancing capability, efficiency,
reliability, and accessibility.

# 5.1 Functional Evaluation Frameworks

Functional evaluation assesses core capabilities essential to effective research performance.
5.1.1 Task Completion Capability Assessment. The ability to successfully complete research tasks represents
a fundamental evaluation dimension:
Task Success Rate Metrics. Quantitative assessment of task completion provides objective performance
measures. Standardized evaluation suites like WebArena [332] measure successful completion of web-based

[PAGE 36]
36 Xu et al.

research tasks. For instance, AutoGLM [330] achieves a 55.2% success rate on VAB-WebArena-Lite (improving
to 59.1% on a second attempt) and 96.2% on OpenTable evaluation tasks. Similarly, benchmarks like
MobileArena evaluate successful completion of mobile interface tasks, where AutoGLM [330] demonstrates a
36.2% success rate on AndroidLab and 89.7% on common tasks in popular Chinese apps [153]. Domain-
specific benchmarks, such as AutoPenBench for generative agents in penetration testing [85], provide further
targeted assessments. These benchmarks provide meaningful comparative metrics, though with limitations
in representing real-world research complexity.
These benchmarks provide meaningful comparative metrics, though with limitations in representing real-
world research complexity. Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] explicitly highlights this distinction, noting that
while benchmark performance provides comparative indicators, practical effectiveness depends significantly
on task characteristics and domain specifics.

Multi-Attempt Resolution Rates. Effective research often involves iterative refinement with multiple
attempts. Advanced evaluation frameworks incorporate multi-attempt metrics that assess system resilience
and adaptability. AutoGLM [154] demonstrates significant performance improvement with second attempts
(55.2% to 59.1% on WebArena-Lite), highlighting the importance of error recovery and adaptive strategies
in practical research contexts.
Open-source frameworks like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] explicitly emphasize iterative improvement through
reinforcement learning approaches, demonstrating how evaluation methods that consider adaptability provide
more comprehensive assessment than single-attempt metrics alone.

5.1.2 Information Retrieval Quality Evaluation. Effective information gathering forms the foundation of
successful research:

Search Effectiveness Metrics. Information retrieval quality significantly impacts overall research per-
formance. Evaluation frameworks employ metrics including precision (relevance of retrieved informa-
tion), recall (comprehensiveness of coverage), and F1 scores (balanced measure of both). Systems like
Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] demonstrate particular strength in recall metrics, effectively identifying
comprehensive information across diverse sources.
Specialized information retrieval benchmarks like TREC [214] provide standardized assessment of search
effectiveness. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no specific evidence that the Deep Research
systems from OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, or any of the open-source projects listed in this survey have
been formally evaluated on TREC benchmarks [214] . This limitation motivates domain-specific evaluation
approaches that better reflect particular research requirements.

Source Diversity Assessment. Comprehensive research requires balanced information from diverse per-
spectives and sources. Advanced evaluation frameworks incorporate explicit diversity metrics that assess the
breadth of source utilization. Commercial systems like [60] emphasize source diversity
Gemini/DeepResearch
as a key performance indicator, while open implementations like dzhng/deep-research [321] incorporate
specific mechanisms to ensure balanced source consideration.
Emerging evaluation approaches include explicit source spectra analysis that examines distribution
across domains, perspectives, and publication types. These methods provide more nuanced assessment of

[PAGE 37]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 37

information gathering quality beyond simple relevance metrics, addressing concerns about potential bias in
automated research processes.

5.1.3 Knowledge Synthesis Accuracy Assessment. Transforming information into accurate, coherent insights
represents a crucial capability:

Factual Consistency Metrics. Reliable research requires accurate synthesis without introducing errors
or misrepresentations. Evaluation frameworks employ fact verification techniques that compare generated
content against source materials, identifying potential inaccuracies or unsupported claims. Systems like
grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] emphasize factual verification through explicit source linking, enabling
direct accuracy assessment. Benchmark suites like TruthfulQA [151] assess the truthfulness of language models
under challenging conditions. While specific accuracy figures for OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Perplexity/
DeepResearch [209] on TruthfulQA [151] are not publicly available, these systems have demonstrated notable
performance on other rigorous benchmarks. For instance, [197] achieved a 26.6%
OpenAI/DeepResearch
accuracy [197] on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) [212]. Similarly, Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] attained a
21.1% accuracy [209] on the same benchmark. The development of unified, fine-grained, and multi-dimensional
evaluation frameworks for summarization further advances the ability to assess the quality of synthesized
content from LLMs [137]. These metrics provide standardized comparison points, though with recognized
limitations in representing the complexity of real-world research synthesis.

Logical Coherence Assessment. Effective research requires logically sound integration of information into
coherent analyses. Sophisticated evaluation approaches employ reasoning validity assessment that examines
logical structures and inference patterns in research outputs. This dimension proves particularly challenging
for automated assessment, often requiring expert human evaluation for reliable scoring.
Commercial systems like [197] and [60] emphasize logical
OpenAI/DeepResearch Gemini/DeepResearch
coherence in their evaluation frameworks, while open-source alternatives like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher
[249] incorporate simplified but useful logical consistency checks. These approaches highlight the importance
of sound reasoning in effective research outputs beyond simple factual accuracy.

# 5.2 Non-Functional Evaluation Metrics

Beyond core functionality, practical effectiveness depends on operational characteristics that impact usability
and deployment.

5.2.1 Performance and Efficiency Metrics. Operational efficiency significantly impacts practical utility:

Response Time Profiling. Timeliness represents a crucial dimension of research effectiveness. Evaluation
frameworks incorporate response time metrics that measure completion duration across standardized tasks.
Commercial systems demonstrate varying performance characteristics, with [209]
Perplexity/DeepResearch
achieving relatively quick response times (2-5 minutes for moderate tasks) while OpenAI/DeepResearch [197]
typically requires longer processing (5-10 minutes) for similar complexity.
Open-source implementations generally demonstrate longer response times, though with significant
variation based on implementation approaches and deployment environments. Systems like nickscamara/

[PAGE 38]
38 Xu et al.

open-deep-research [42] emphasize accessibility over performance optimization, while QwenLM/Qwen-Agent
[224] incorporates specific optimizations to enhance response times within resource constraints.

Resource Utilization Assessment. Computational efficiency enables broader deployment and accessibility.
Comprehensive evaluation includes resource profiling that measures memory consumption, computational
requirements, and energy utilization across standardized workloads. Specialized benchmarks like Minerva
assess programmable memory capabilities of language models, offering insights into their efficiency in
handling long-context information [300]. Commercial cloud-based systems obscure some of these metrics due
to their managed infrastructure, though with operational costs providing indirect resource indicators. Open
implementations like Camel-AI/OWL [43] and AutoGLM-Research [330] provide more transparent resource
profiles, enabling direct assessment of deployment requirements and operational economics. These metrics
highlight significant variation in efficiency across the ecosystem, with implications for practical deployment
scenarios and accessibility.

5.2.2 Reliability and Stability Metrics. Consistent performance under diverse conditions ensures practical
usability:

Error Rate Analysis. Reliability under challenging conditions significantly impacts user trust and adoption.
Robust evaluation frameworks incorporate error rate metrics that measure failure frequency across diverse
scenarios. Commercial systems generally demonstrate lower error rates compared to open-source alternatives,
though with remaining challenges in complex or novel research contexts.
Specialized reliability testing employs adversarial scenarios designed to trigger failure modes, providing
insight into system robustness. Systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] incor-
porate explicit error recovery mechanisms that enhance reliability under challenging conditions, highlighting
the importance of resilience in practical research applications.

Long-Term Stability Assessment. Consistent performance over extended operation provides crucial deploy-
ment confidence. Comprehensive evaluation includes stability metrics that measure performance consistency
across extended sessions and repeated executions. This dimension proves particularly relevant for open-source
implementations that must operate in diverse deployment environments with varying infrastructure stability.
Systems like Flowith/OracleMode [77] and TARS [39] emphasize operational stability through robust
error handling and recovery mechanisms, enabling reliable performance in production environments. These
capabilities highlight the importance of engineering quality beyond core algorithmic performance in practical
research applications.

5.2.3 User Experience and Usability Metrics. Effective interaction significantly impacts practical utility:

Interface Usability Assessment. Intuitive interfaces enhance accessibility and effective utilization. Usability
evaluation frameworks employ standardized usability metrics including System Usability Scale (SUS) [140]
scores and task completion time measurements. Commercial systems typically demonstrate stronger usability
characteristics, with Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] particularly emphasizing intuitive interaction for non-
technical users. Open-source alternatives show greater variability, with implementations like HKUDS/Auto-
Deep-Research [112] incorporating specific interface enhancements to improve accessibility.

[PAGE 39]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 39

User studies provide more nuanced usability assessment beyond standardized metrics. Evaluations
of systems like Manus [164] and Flowith/OracleMode [77] incorporate explicit user feedback to identify
interaction challenges and improvement opportunities. These approaches highlight the importance of human-
centered design in practical research applications beyond technical performance. Similarly, frameworks such
as AdaptoML-UX [87] enable HCI researchers to employ automated ML pipelines without specialized expertise,
facilitating robust model development and customization.

Learning Curve Assessment. Approachability for new users significantly impacts adoption and effective
utilization. Comprehensive evaluation includes learning curve metrics that measure time-to-proficiency
across user segments with varying technical backgrounds. Commercial systems generally demonstrate gentler
learning curves, with [209] explicitly designed for accessibility to non-technical
Perplexity/DeepResearch
users.
Open implementations show greater variability, with systems like n8n [183] requiring more technical
expertise for effective deployment and utilization. More accessible alternatives like nickscamara/open-
deep-research [42] incorporate simplified interfaces designed for broader accessibility, highlighting diverse
approaches to the accessibility-sophistication balance across the ecosystem.

# 5.3 Cross-Domain Evaluation Benchmarks
## 5.3 Cross-Domain Evaluation Benchmarks (part 1)

5.3 Cross-Domain Evaluation Benchmarks

Standardized benchmarks enable objective comparison across systems and domains.

5.3.1 Academic Research Task Benchmarks. Specialized benchmarks assess capabilities relevant to scholarly
research:

Literature Review Benchmarks. Comprehensive literature synthesis represents a fundamental academic
research task requiring sophisticated information retrieval, critical analysis, and synthesis capabilities. To
the best of our knowledge, no benchmark suite is specifically designed to evaluate systems’ ability to identify
relevant literature, synthesize key findings, and highlight research gaps across scientific domains. We propose
leveraging existing high-quality literature reviews published in Nature Reviews journals as gold standards.
Citation networks from academic knowledge graphs—such as Microsoft Academic Graph, Semantic Scholar
Academic Graph, and Open Academic Graph—could provide complementary evaluation data by measuring
a system’s ability to traverse citation relationships and identify seminal works[1, 31].
While direct literature review benchmarks remain underdeveloped, several indirect benchmarks offer
insight into related capabilities. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] demonstrates leading performance, achieving
26.6% accuracy on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) [212] and averaging 72.57% on the GAIA benchmark
[172], reflecting strong performance in complex reasoning tasks essential for literature synthesis. Similarly,
Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] achieves 21.1% accuracy on HLE [212] and 93.9% on SimpleQA [290],
indicating robust factual retrieval capabilities.
These benchmarks include challenging cases requiring integration across multiple disciplines, identification
of methodological limitations, and disambiguation of conflicting findings—all crucial for effective literature
review. Such tasks demonstrate the importance of sophisticated reasoning capabilities beyond simple
information retrieval. While specific performance metrics for systems like [43] are not publicly
Camel-AI/OWL

[PAGE 40]
40 Xu et al.

available, their specialized academic optimization suggests potential effectiveness in handling complex
synthesis tasks.

Methodology Evaluation Benchmarks. Critical assessment of research methodology requires sophisticated
analytical capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, no benchmark is specifically designed for quantitative
methodology assessment of strengths and limitations. A comprehensive methodology evaluation benchmark
would need to assess a system’s ability to identify flaws in research design, statistical approaches, sampling
methods, and interpretive limitations across diverse disciplines. An effective benchmark might incorporate
multi-layered evaluation criteria including: reproducibility assessment, identification of confounding variables,
appropriate statistical power analysis, and proper handling of uncertainty. Future benchmarks could utilize
expert-annotated corpora of research papers with methodological strengths and weaknesses clearly marked,
creating a gold standard against which systems’ analytical capabilities can be measured while minimizing
bias through diverse evaluation metrics that reflect methodological best practices across different fields of
inquiry.
Beyond standard benchmarks, case study evaluations of complete AI scientist systems provide valuable
insights into current capabilities. Beel et al. [24] conduct a detailed assessment of Sakana’s AI Scientist
for autonomous research, examining whether current implementations represent genuine progress toward
“Artificial Research Intelligence” or remain limited in fundamental ways, highlighting the gap between current
benchmarks and comprehensive research capability evaluation.

5.3.2 Business Analysis Task Benchmarks. Standardized evaluation for business intelligence applications:

Market Analysis Benchmarks. Strategic decision support necessitates a comprehensive understanding
of market dynamics. Advanced AI systems, such as OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], are designed to analyze
competitive landscapes, identify market trends, and generate strategic recommendations based on diverse
business information. OpenAI/DeepResearch has demonstrated significant capabilities in handling complex,
multi-domain data analysis tasks, providing detailed insights and personalized recommendations. Similarly,
Google’s Gemini/DeepResearch [60] offers robust performance in processing extensive datasets, delivering
concise and factual reports efficiently.
These benchmarks include challenging scenarios requiring integration of quantitative financial data with
qualitative market dynamics and regulatory considerations. Such tasks highlight the importance of both
analytical depth and domain knowledge, with systems like Manus [164] demonstrating strong performance
through specialized business intelligence capabilities.

Financial Analysis Benchmarks. Economic assessment requires sophisticated quantitative reasoning
combined with contextual understanding of market dynamics. The FinEval benchmark [103] provides a
standardized framework for measuring systems’ capabilities in analyzing financial statements, evaluating
investment opportunities, and assessing economic risk factors across diverse scenarios. To our knowledge, no
Deep Research projects have yet published official FinEval benchmark results, though several commercial
demonstrations suggest strong performance in this domain. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] has demonstrated
particular strength in quantitative financial analysis through its ability to process complex numerical
data while incorporating relevant market context. Meanwhile, open-source implementations show more
variable performance, though specialized systems like n8n [183] achieve competitive results through strategic

[PAGE 41]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 41

integration with financial data sources and analytical tools. These patterns highlight the critical importance
of domain-specific integrations and data accessibility in financial analysis applications, extending beyond
core language model capabilities to create truly effective analytical systems.

5.3.3 General Knowledge Management Benchmarks. Broad applicability assessment across general research
domains:

Factual Research Benchmarks. Accurate information gathering forms the foundation of effective research.
The SimpleQA benchmark [290] evaluates language models’ ability to answer short, fact-seeking questions
with a single, indisputable answer. [209] demonstrates exceptional performance
Perplexity/DeepResearch
on this benchmark, achieving an accuracy of 93.9% [209]. OpenAI’s Deep Research tool, integrated into
ChatGPT, offers comprehensive research capabilities, though specific accuracy metrics on SimpleQA [290] are
not publicly disclosed [197]. Similarly, Google’s Gemini/DeepResearch provides robust information synthesis
features, but detailed performance data on SimpleQA [290] is not available.
These metrics provide useful baseline performance indicators, though with recognized limitations in repre-
senting more complex research workflows. Comparative evaluation highlights the importance of information
quality beyond simple factual recall, with sophisticated systems demonstrating more nuanced performance
profiles across complex tasks.

## 5.3 Cross-Domain Evaluation Benchmarks (part 2)

Humanities and Social Sciences Benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluation requires assessment beyond STEM
domains. The MMLU benchmark [33] evaluates systems’ performance across humanities and social science
research tasks, including historical analysis, ethical evaluation, and social trend identification. Performance
shows greater variability compared to STEM-focused tasks, with generally lower accuracy across all systems
while maintaining similar relative performance patterns. These benchmarks highlight remaining challenges
in domains requiring nuanced contextual understanding and interpretive reasoning. Commercial systems
maintain performance leads, though with open alternatives like smolagents/open_deep_research [115]
demonstrating competitive capabilities in specific humanities domains through specialized component design.

# 5.4 Emerging Evaluation Approaches

Beyond established benchmarks, novel evaluation methods address unique aspects of Deep Research perfor-
mance.

Interactive Evaluation Frameworks. Traditional static benchmarks often fail to capture the dynamic and
interactive nature of real-world research workflows. To address this gap, interactive evaluation frameworks
have been developed to assess AI systems’ abilities to iteratively refine research strategies through multiple
interaction rounds. Notably, QuestBench [141] is a novel benchmark which specifically assesses an AI system’s
ability to identify missing information and ask appropriate clarification questions, a crucial skill for real-world
research scenarios where problems are often underspecified. To the best of our knowledge, no deep research
system invested in this survey has yet been publicly evaluated using QuestBench. Nonetheless, these systems
have demonstrated strong performance in other interactive evaluations, highlighting their effectiveness in
supporting iterative research processes.

[PAGE 42]
42 Xu et al.

Multimodal Research Evaluation. Comprehensive research increasingly involves diverse content modalities.
Advanced evaluation frameworks incorporate multimodal assessment that measures systems’ ability to
integrate information across text, images, data visualizations, and structured content. Commercial systems
generally demonstrate stronger multimodal capabilities, with Gemini/DeepResearch [60] particularly excelling
in image-inclusive research tasks.
Open implementations show emerging multimodal capabilities, with systems like
Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch
[121] incorporating specific components for multimodal content processing. These approaches highlight
the growing importance of cross-modal integration in practical research applications beyond text-centric
evaluation.

Ethical and Bias Assessment. Responsible research requires careful attention to ethical considerations
and potential biases. Comprehensive evaluation increasingly incorporates explicit assessment of ethical
awareness, bias detection, and fairness in information processing. Commercial systems implement sophis-
ticated safeguards, with [197] incorporating explicit ethical guidelines and bias
OpenAI/DeepResearch
mitigation strategies. Open implementations show varied approaches to these considerations, with systems
like grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] emphasizing transparency in source selection and attribution.
These evaluation dimensions highlight the importance of responsibility beyond technical performance,
addressing growing concerns about potential amplification of existing information biases through automated
research systems. Ongoing development of standardized ethical evaluation frameworks represents an active
area of research with significant implications for system design and deployment.
The diverse evaluation approaches outlined in this section highlight both the complexity of comprehensive
assessment and the ongoing evolution of evaluation methodologies alongside system capabilities. While
standard benchmarks provide useful comparative metrics, practical effectiveness depends on alignment
between system capabilities, evaluation criteria, and specific application requirements. This alignment
represents a key consideration for both system developers and adopters seeking to integrate Deep Research
capabilities into practical workflows.

# 5.5 Comparative Evaluation Methodology

To ensure systematic and consistent evaluation across diverse Deep Research systems, we have developed a
comprehensive evaluation framework. This section outlines our methodological approach, evaluation criteria
selection, and application consistency across systems.

5.5.1 Systems Selection Criteria. Our evaluation encompasses various Deep Research systems selected based
on the following criteria:

∙ Functional Completeness: Systems must implement at least two of the three core dimensions of Deep
Research as defined in Section 1.1
∙ Public Documentation: Sufficient technical documentation must be available to enable meaningful
analysis
∙ Active Development: Systems must have demonstrated active development or usage within the past
12 months

[PAGE 43]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 43

∙ Representational Balance: Selection ensures balanced representation of commercial, open-source,
general-purpose, and domain-specialized implementations

5.5.2 Evaluation Dimensions and Metrics Application. Our evaluation employs a consistent set of dimensions
across all systems, though the specific benchmarks within each dimension vary based on system focus and
available performance data. Table 15 presents the evaluation coverage across representative systems.

Table 15. Evaluation Metrics Application Across Systems

5.5.3 Data Collection Methods. Our evaluation data comes from four primary sources:

1. Published Benchmarks: Performance metrics reported in peer-reviewed literature or official system documentation
2. Technical Documentation Analysis: Capabilities and limitations outlined in official documentation, APIs, and technical specifications
3. Repository Examination: Analysis of open-source code repositories for architectural patterns and implementation approaches
4. Experimental Verification: Where inconsistencies exist, we conducted direct testing of publicly available systems to verify capabilities

When benchmark results are unavailable for specific systems, we indicate this gap explicitly rather than
extrapolating performance. This approach ensures transparency regarding the limits of our comparative
analysis while maintaining the integrity of available evaluation data.

5.5.4 Cross-System Comparison Challenges. Several methodological challenges exist in comparing Deep
Research systems:

∙ Benchmark Diversity: Different systems emphasize different benchmarks based on their focus areas
∙ Implementation Transparency: Commercial systems often provide limited details about internal
architectures
∙ Rapid Evolution: Systems undergo frequent updates, potentially rendering specific benchmark results
obsolete
∙ Domain Specialization: Domain-specific systems excel on targeted benchmarks but may perform
poorly on general evaluations

[PAGE 44]
44 Xu et al.

We address these challenges through qualitative architectural analysis alongside quantitative benchmarks,
enabling meaningful comparison despite data limitations. Section 3.3 presents the resulting comparative anal-
ysis, highlighting both performance differentials and the limitations of direct comparison across heterogeneous
implementations.

6 Applications and Use Cases
The technical capabilities of Deep Research systems enable transformative applications across diverse
domains. This section examines implementation patterns, domain-specific adaptations, and representative
use cases that demonstrate the practical impact of these technologies.

Deep Research systems offer significant enhancements to scholarly research workflows.

[PAGE 45]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 45

6.1.1 Literature Review and Synthesis. Comprehensive literature analysis forms the foundation of effective
research:

Systematic Review Automation. Deep Research systems demonstrate particular effectiveness for system-
atic literature reviews requiring exhaustive coverage of existing research. Systems like Google’s Gemini/
DeepResearch [60] can efficiently analyze thousands of research papers, a capability that has significant
implications for fields like biomedicine where the volume of literature makes comprehensive manual re-
view increasingly challenging [289]. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] has been successfully deployed for medical
research reviews, analyzing thousands of publications to identify intervention efficacy patterns with sig-
nificantly reduced human effort compared to traditional methods. Similar capabilities are evident in
Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] and Gemini/DeepResearch [60], which enables rapid synthesis of research
findings across disciplinary boundaries. Generative AI frameworks integrating retrieval-augmented generation
further automate systematic reviews by expanding user queries to retrieve relevant scholarly articles and
reduce time and resource burdens [234].
Open-source implementations like dzhng/deep-research [321] have found adoption in academic settings
where local deployment and customization are prioritized. Specialized scientific implementations like AI-
Researcher [109] extend these capabilities with domain-specific optimizations for academic literature
processing and analysis. These systems enable literature review automation with greater control over search
scope and synthesis methods, particularly valuable for specialized research domains with unique requirements.
Implementation patterns typically involve customization of search strategies, source weightings, and output
formats to align with disciplinary conventions.

Research Gap Identification. Beyond simple synthesis, advanced systems effectively identify unexplored
areas and research opportunities. Gemini/DeepResearch [60] has demonstrated this capability in inter-
disciplinary contexts, identifying connection opportunities between distinct research domains that might
otherwise remain undiscovered. This application leverages the system’s ability to process extensive literature
across fields while identifying patterns and absences in existing research coverage.
Open implementations like HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] incorporate specific mechanisms for gap
analysis, including explicit detection of methodological limitations and underexplored variables across
research corpora. These capabilities highlight the potential for automated systems to not only synthesize
existing knowledge but actively contribute to research direction through systematic gap identification.

6.1.2 Hypothesis Generation and Testing. AI-assisted hypothesis development enhances research creativity
and validation:

Hypothesis Formulation Support. Deep Research systems effectively generate testable hypotheses based
on existing literature and theoretical frameworks. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] provides explicit hypothesis
generation capabilities, identifying potential causal relationships and testable predictions derived from
literature synthesis. These features enable researchers to explore broader possibility spaces than might be
practical through manual review alone.
Specialized frameworks like Camel-AI/OWL [43] implement domain-specific hypothesis generation for
scientific applications, incorporating field-specific constraints and validation criteria. These approaches
highlight how domain adaptation enhances the practical utility of hypothesis generation capabilities beyond

[PAGE 46]
46 Xu et al.

generic formulation. Implementation patterns typically involve iterative refinement with researcher feedback
to align generated hypotheses with specific research objectives.

Preliminary Validation Assessment. Advanced systems support hypothesis validation through evidence
assessment and methodological planning. Gemini/DeepResearch [60] enables preliminary hypothesis testing
through automated data source identification, statistical power analysis, and potential confound identification.
These capabilities streamline the transition from hypothesis formulation to empirical testing, reducing manual
effort in research design.
Open implementations like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] incorporate specific validation planning components,
guiding researchers through experimental design considerations based on hypothesis characteristics. These
approaches demonstrate how Deep Research capabilities extend beyond information gathering to actively
support the complete research workflow from conception through validation planning.

6.1.3 Interdisciplinary Research Support. Cross-domain integration represents a particular strength of auto-

Moreover, Automated Capability Discovery (ACD) [158] automates the evaluation of foundation models by
designating one model as a scientist to propose open-ended tasks that systematically uncover unexpected
capabilities and failures. Similarly, SeqMate [178] utilizes large language models to automate RNA sequencing
data preparation and analysis, enabling user-friendly one-click analytics and report generation for biologists.
The FutureHouse Platform [253] broadens accessibility by delivering the first publicly available superintelli-
gent AI agents for scientific discovery through web interfaces and APIs. These implementations highlight
both the significant potential and current limitations of autonomous scientific discovery systems, suggesting
an evolutionary path toward increasingly capable research automation while maintaining appropriate human

7 Ethical Considerations and Limitations

The integration of Deep Research systems into knowledge workflows introduces significant ethical considera-
tions and technical limitations that must be addressed for responsible deployment. This section examines
key challenges across four fundamental dimensions (see Figure 10): information integrity, privacy protection,
source attribution and intellectual property, and accessibility.

# 7.1 Information Accuracy and Hallucination Concerns
## 7.1 Information Accuracy and Hallucination Concerns (part 1)

7.1 Information Accuracy and Hallucination Concerns
Deep Research systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining factual reliability despite their sophisti-
cated capabilities.

7.1.1 Factual Verification Mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted significant challenges in reliable
uncertainty communication [55], with particular concerns for research contexts where uncertainty boundaries
may be unclear or contested. Some researchers have raised concerns about excessive reliance on AI-generated
content in scholarly writing [27, 45, 104, 119, 146, 207, 282, 286, 324, 335], particularly when verification
mechanisms are inadequate or bypassed. These limitations are further complicated by tendencies toward
misleading responses in conversation [113], presenting particular challenges for interactive research workflows
where iterative refinement may inadvertently amplify initial inaccuracies. AI support systems designed for

evidence-based expository writing tasks, such as literature reviews, offer frameworks to enhance verification
through structured sensemaking over source documents [247]. Addressing these challenges requires technical
advancements in uncertainty representation, improvements in decision workflow design[107] and interface
design improvements that effectively communicate confidence boundaries to research users[270].
Ensuring information accuracy requires explicit verification strategies:
Source Verification Approaches. Leading implementations incorporate explicit source validation mecha-
nisms to enhance factual reliability. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] implements multi-level verification that
confirms information across multiple independent sources before incorporation into research outputs, with
detailed guidelines outlined in their system documentation [196]. Similarly, Perplexity/DeepResearch [209]
implements automated fact-checking that independently verifies key claims against trusted reference sources
before inclusion in final reports.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate varied approaches to verification. Systems like grapeot/deep_
research_agent [263] emphasize explicit citation mechanisms that maintain direct links between claims

[PAGE 58]
58 Xu et al.

and sources, enabling straightforward verification. More sophisticated implementations like HKUDS/Auto-
Deep-Research [112] incorporate specialized verification modules that assess source credibility and content
consistency before information utilization.
Hallucination Detection and Prevention. Mitigating fabricated information represents a crucial challenge
for LLM-based research systems. Commercial implementations employ advanced hallucination reduction
techniques including strict grounding requirements and consistency verification. [60]
Gemini/DeepResearch
implements explicit uncertainty modeling that distinguishes between confirmed information and speculative
extensions, enhancing transparency when definitive answers cannot be provided. Emerging paradigms
like those proposed by Silver and Sutton [251] suggest a fundamental shift toward experience-driven
learning, potentially transforming how research systems acquire and refine capabilities through interaction
with information environments. Such approaches could enable more human-like research development
through continuous improvement based on research experiences rather than static training alone, and could
fundamentally mitigate hallucinations.
Open implementations demonstrate pragmatic approaches to hallucination reduction within more con-
strained technical environments. Systems like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] employ preventative strategies including
explicit sourcing requirements and conservative synthesis guidelines that prioritize factual reliability over
comprehensive coverage. Complementary approaches like Mask-DPO [100] focus on generalizable fine-grained
factuality alignment, addressing a critical requirement for reliable research outputs. Recent work from
the GAIR NLP team on DeepResearcher [81] has advanced these capabilities through integrated neural
verification and knowledge graph alignment techniques that significantly enhance factual reliability. These
approaches highlight diverse strategies for addressing a fundamental challenge that impacts all LLM-based
research systems.

7.1.2 Uncertainty Communication Approaches. Transparent uncertainty representation enhances result inter-
pretation and appropriate utilization:
Confidence Estimation Methods. Advanced systems implement explicit confidence assessment for research
findings and recommendations. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] incorporates graduated confidence scoring that
reflects evidence quality, consistency across sources, and reasoning reliability. This capability enhances result
interpretation by clearly distinguishing between well-supported conclusions and more speculative findings.
Open-source implementations demonstrate simplified but effective confidence communication approaches.
Systems like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249] incorporate basic confidence indicators that signal infor-
mation reliability through explicit markers in research outputs. These approaches highlight the importance
of transparent uncertainty communication regardless of implementation sophistication.
Evidence Qualification Standards. Responsible systems clearly communicate limitations and contextual
factors affecting result interpretation. Commercial implementations like Perplexity/DeepResearch [209]
incorporate explicit evidence qualification that highlights contextual limitations, conflicting viewpoints, and
temporal constraints affecting research findings. This practice enhances appropriate utilization by providing
necessary context for result interpretation.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate varied approaches to evidence qualification. Systems like dzhng/
deep-research [321] implement explicit limitation statements that identify key constraints affecting research

Pre-Release Verification Standards. Leading implementations employ comprehensive validation processes
before result delivery. Gemini Deep Research implements structured quality verification including automated
consistency checking, source validation, and reasoning verification before providing research outputs. These
practices enhance overall reliability through systematic error identification and correction.
Open-source implementations demonstrate more varied quality control approaches. Systems like nickscamara/
open-deep-research [42] incorporate simplified validation processes focusing on critical reliability factors
including source verification and logical consistency. These approaches highlight how even basic quality
control mechanisms can significantly enhance research reliability.

feedback. As Deep Research systems advance toward greater autonomy, broader safety considerations
become increasingly important. Bengio et al. [26] highlight potential risks from superintelligent agents and
propose approaches like “Scientist AI” that balance capability with safer development paths, emphasizing the
importance of integrated safety mechanisms in advanced research systems. Commercial systems implement
sophisticated feedback integration including explicit accuracy reporting channels and systematic error pattern
analysis. OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] includes dedicated correction mechanisms that incorporate verified
accuracy feedback into system improvements, creating virtuous improvement cycles.
Open implementations demonstrate more community-oriented feedback approaches. Systems like smolagents/
open_deep_research [115] incorporate collaborative improvement frameworks that enable distributed error
identification and correction through community contributions. These approaches highlight diverse strategies
for enhancing reliability through user engagement across implementation contexts.

hensive tenant isolation that prevents information leakage between distinct users or organizations. These
practices are particularly crucial for sensitive research applications in corporate or governmental contexts.
Open-source implementations demonstrate varied isolation approaches depending on deployment models.
Systems designed for local deployment like OpenManus [193] enable complete isolation within organizational
boundaries, enhancing privacy for sensitive applications. Cloud-dependent implementations typically in-
corporate more limited isolation mechanisms, highlighting deployment considerations for privacy-sensitive
applications.
Data Minimization Strategies. Responsible systems limit sensitive data collection and retention. Commercial
implementations increasingly emphasize data minimization, collecting only information necessary for service

[PAGE 60]

provision and applying appropriate retention limitations. These practices enhance privacy protection by
reducing potential exposure of sensitive information through either security incidents or authorized access.
Open implementations demonstrate diverse approaches to data management. Systems like Nanobrowser
[184] enable complete local control of browsing data, preventing external exposure of research activities.
Infrastructure frameworks like Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch [121] provide flexible configuration options that
enable deployment-specific privacy controls aligned with organizational requirements.

7.2.2 Sensitive Information Handling. Special safeguards are required for particularly sensitive content
categories:

information. Commercial implementations like Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] incorporate automatic
detection and redaction of personal identifiers from research outputs unless specifically relevant to research
objectives. These practices prevent inadvertent exposure of personal information through research activities.
Open implementations demonstrate more varied approaches to identifier management. Systems like TARS
[39] incorporate basic identifier detection focused on common patterns like email addresses and phone
numbers. More sophisticated implementations like QwenLM/Qwen-Agent [224] provide configurable sensitivity
controls that enable context-appropriate protection aligned with specific deployment requirements.

information categories. Commercial implementations increasingly incorporate specialized handling for
information categories including health data, financial records, and other regulated content types. These
practices enhance compliance with domain-specific regulatory requirements governing sensitive information.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate more varied regulatory alignment. Systems like n8n [183] provide
specialized workflow components for handling regulated data categories, enabling compliance-oriented
implementations in sensitive domains. These approaches highlight how specialized components can address
domain-specific regulatory requirements within flexible implementation frameworks.

7.2.3 Compliance with Regulatory Frameworks. Adherence to applicable regulations ensures legally appropri-
ate operation:
Jurisdictional Compliance Adaptation. Advanced systems implement regionally appropriate operational
standards. Commercial implementations increasingly incorporate jurisdiction-specific adaptations that align
with regional privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and other frameworks. These practices enhance
legal compliance across diverse deployment environments with varying regulatory requirements.
Open implementations demonstrate more deployment-dependent compliance approaches. Systems designed
for flexible deployment like Flowith/OracleMode [77] provide configurable privacy controls that enable
adaptation to specific regulatory environments. These approaches highlight the importance of adaptable
privacy frameworks that can address diverse compliance requirements across implementation contexts.
Transparency and Control Mechanisms. Responsible systems provide appropriate visibility and user
authority over information processing. Emerging regulatory frameworks are increasingly focusing on AI
agents with autonomous capabilities. Osogami [204] proposes that regulation of autonomous AI systems
should specifically consider action sequence patterns rather than individual actions in isolation, which has
particular implications for Deep Research systems that execute complex multi-step research workflows.
Commercial implementations increasingly emphasize transparency through explicit processing disclosures

[PAGE 61]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 61

and user control mechanisms aligned with regulatory requirements. These practices enhance both regulatory
compliance and user trust through appropriate information governance.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate varied transparency approaches. Systems like HKUDS/Auto-Deep-
Research [112] provide detailed logging of information access and processing activities, enabling appropriate
oversight and verification. These approaches highlight how transparent operation can enhance both compliance
and trust across implementation contexts.

# 7.3 Source Attribution and Intellectual Property

grapeot/deep_research_agent [263] implement explicit source-claim mapping that maintains clear relation-
ships between information and origins. These approaches highlight the importance of systematic attribution
regardless of implementation sophistication.

7.3.2 Intellectual Attribution Challenges. Special attribution considerations apply to complex intellectual
contributions:
Idea Attribution Practices. Research systems must appropriately acknowledge conceptual contributions
beyond factual information. Commercial implementations increasingly emphasize concept-level attribution
that acknowledges intellectual frameworks and theoretical approaches beyond simple facts. These practices
enhance ethical information utilization by appropriately recognizing intellectual contributions.
Open implementations demonstrate varied idea attribution approaches. Systems like Camel-AI/OWL [43]
incorporate explicit concept attribution that identifies theoretical frameworks and analytical approaches
utilized in research outputs. These approaches highlight the importance of comprehensive attribution beyond
basic factual sources.
Synthesized Knowledge Attribution. Attribution becomes particularly challenging for insights synthesized
across multiple sources. Advanced systems implement specialized attribution approaches for synthetic insights

[PAGE 62]
62 Xu et al.

that acknowledge multiple contributing sources while clearly identifying novel connections. These practices
enhance attribution accuracy for the increasingly common scenario of cross-source synthesis.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate pragmatic approaches to synthesis attribution. Systems like Agent-
RL/ReSearch [2] implement explicit synthesis markers that distinguish between directly sourced information
and system-generated connections. These approaches highlight the importance of transparent derivation
even when direct attribution becomes challenging.

7.3.3 Copyright and Fair Use Considerations. Research activities interact with copyright protections in
multiple dimensions:
Fair Use Evaluation Mechanisms. Research systems must navigate appropriate utilization of copyrighted
materials. Commercial implementations increasingly incorporate fair use evaluation that considers purpose,
nature, amount, and market impact when utilizing copyrighted content. These practices enhance legal
compliance while enabling appropriate information utilization for legitimate research purposes.
Open implementations demonstrate varied copyright approaches. Systems like Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch
[121] incorporate basic copyright acknowledgment focusing on proper attribution, while more sophisticated al-
ternatives like Manus [164] provide enhanced copyright handling including content transformation assessment
and restricted access mechanisms for sensitive materials.
Content Licensing Compliance. Responsible systems respect diverse license terms applicable to utilized
content. Advanced implementations increasingly incorporate license-aware processing that adapts information
utilization based on specific terms governing particular sources. These practices enhance compliance with
varied license requirements across the information ecosystem.
Open implementations demonstrate more standardized licensing approaches. Systems like grapeot/deep_
research_agent [263] incorporate simplified license categorization focusing on common frameworks including
creative commons and commercial restrictions. These approaches highlight pragmatic strategies for license
navigation within resource constraints.

7.3.4 Output Intellectual Property Frameworks. Clear rights management for research outputs enhances
downstream utilization:
Output License Assignment. Complex questions arise regarding intellectual property in research outputs.
Commercial systems increasingly implement explicit license assignment for generated content, clarifying
intellectual property status for downstream utilization. These practices enhance transparency regarding
usage rights for research outputs created through automated systems.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate varied approaches to output rights. Systems like OpenManus [193]
incorporate explicit license designation for research outputs aligned with organizational policies and source
restrictions. These approaches highlight the importance of clear intellectual property frameworks regardless
of implementation context.
Derivative Work Management. Research systems must address whether outputs constitute derivative
works of source materials. Commercial systems increasingly implement derivative assessment frameworks
that evaluate the nature and extent of source transformation in research outputs. These practices enhance
appropriate categorization for downstream utilization aligned with source licenses.
Open-source alternatives demonstrate varied derivation approaches. Systems such as QwenLM/Qwen-Agent
[224] incorporate a basic transformation assessment focusing on content reorganization and analytical

[PAGE 63]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 63

addition. These approaches highlight the importance of thoughtful derivative consideration regardless of
implementation sophistication.

# 7.4 Accessibility and Digital Divide

Equitable access to research capabilities requires addressing systematic barriers.

7.4.1 Technology Access Disparities. Recent work has highlighted both adoption barriers and opportunities
for making Deep Research systems more accessible. Bianchini et al. [29] and Tonghe Zhuang et al. [334]
identify specific organizational and individual factors affecting AI adoption in scientific research contexts,
with implications for Deep Research deployment. Accessibility-focused approaches like those presented by
Mowar et al. [179] demonstrate how AI coding assistants can be specifically designed to support accessible
development practices, suggesting parallel opportunities for accessibility-centered Deep Research systems.
Extending this, systems such as ResearchAgent [18] showcase how AI can lower barriers to scientific
innovation by enabling iterative refinement of research ideas through collaborative feedback mechanisms,
thus democratizing access to complex ideation processes.
Resource requirements create potential exclusion for various user segments:
Computational Requirement Considerations. Resource-intensive systems may exclude users without sub-
stantial computing access. Commercial cloud-based implementations address this challenge through shared
infrastructure that reduces local requirements, though with associated cost barriers. Open-source alternatives
demonstrate varied resource profiles, with systems like Camel-AI/OWL [43] emphasizing efficiency to enable
broader deployment on limited hardware.
Cost Barrier Mitigation. Financial requirements create systematic access disparities across socioeco-
nomic dimensions. Commercial implementations demonstrate varied pricing approaches, with systems like
Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] offering limited free access alongside premium tiers. Open-source alter-
natives like HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] and nickscamara/open-deep-research [42] eliminate direct
cost barriers while potentially introducing technical hurdles.

7.4.2 User Expertise Requirements. Technical complexity creates additional access barriers beyond resource
considerations:
Technical Expertise Dependencies. Complex system deployment and operation may exclude users without
specialized knowledge. Commercial implementations address this challenge through managed services that
eliminate deployment complexity, though with reduced customization flexibility. Open-source alternatives
demonstrate varied usability profiles, with systems like OpenManus [193] emphasizing simplified deployment
to enhance accessibility despite local operation.
Domain Knowledge Prerequisites. Effective research still requires contextual understanding for appropriate
utilization. Both commercial and open-source implementations increasingly incorporate domain guidance
that assists users with limited background knowledge in specific research areas. These capabilities enhance
accessibility by reducing domain expertise barriers to effective research utilization.

7.4.3 Inclusivity and Universal Design Approaches. Deliberate inclusive design can address systematic access
barriers:

[PAGE 64]
64 Xu et al.

Linguistic and Cultural Inclusivity. Language limitations create significant barriers for non-dominant
language communities. Commercial implementations increasingly offer multilingual capabilities, though with
persistent quality disparities across languages. Open-source alternatives demonstrate varied language support,
with systems like Flowith/OracleMode [77] emphasizing extensible design that enables community-driven
language expansion beyond dominant languages.
Disability Accommodation Approaches. Accessible design ensures appropriate access for users with diverse
abilities. Commercial implementations increasingly incorporate accessibility features including screen reader
compatibility, keyboard navigation, and alternative format generation. Open-source alternatives demonstrate
more varied accessibility profiles, highlighting an area for continued community development to ensure
equitable access across implementation contexts.
The ethical considerations explored in this section highlight the complex responsibilities associated with
Deep Research technologies beyond technical performance. While current implementations demonstrate
varying approaches to these challenges across commercial and open-source ecosystems, consistent patterns
emerge in the importance of factual verification, attribution quality, privacy protection, intellectual property
respect, and accessible design. Addressing these considerations represents a critical priority for responsible
development and deployment of these increasingly influential research technologies.

8 Future Research Directions
The rapidly evolving field of Deep Research presents numerous opportunities for technical advancement
and application expansion. Recent work by Zheng et al. [329] proposes scaling deep research capabilities
via reinforcement learning in real-world environments, while Wu et al. [297] explore enhancing reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tools specifically for deep research applications. The comprehensive framework for
building effective agents outlined by Anthropic [11] provides additional design principles that could inform
future Deep Research systems. This section examines promising research directions (illustrated in Figure 11)
that could significantly enhance capabilities, address current limitations, and expand practical impact across
domains, focusing on four key areas: advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal integration, domain
specialization, and human-AI collaboration with standardization.

# 8.1 Advanced Reasoning Architectures
## 8.1 Advanced Reasoning Architectures (part 1)

8.1 Advanced Reasoning Architectures
Enhanced reasoning capabilities represent a fundamental advancement opportunity for next-generation
systems.

8.1.1 Context Window Optimization and Management. The information-intensive nature of deep research
tasks presents fundamental challenges for context window utilization:
Information Compression and Prioritization. Current systems struggle with context window exhaustion when
processing extensive research materials. Future architectures could incorporate sophisticated compression
mechanisms that maintain semantic content while reducing token consumption. Early steps in this direction
appear in systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], which implements basic summarization for lengthy
sources. Recent work on academic paper review systems demonstrates how hierarchical processing of
extended research content can maintain coherence while managing context limitations [333]. Semantic
navigation techniques offer complementary approaches by enabling efficient exploration of problem-solution

spaces within constrained domains, optimizing context usage through input filtering while enhancing
generation quality [238]. More advanced approaches could develop adaptive compression that preserves
crucial details while condencing secondary information based on query relevance.
Implementation opportunities include developing hierarchical summarization techniques that maintain
multi-level representations of sources, implementing information relevance scoring that prioritizes context
allocation to critical content, and designing dynamic context management that continuously optimizes
window utilization throughout research workflows. These advances could significantly enhance information
processing capabilities without requiring proportional increases in context length.
External Memory Architectures. Beyond compression, architectural innovations could fundamentally
transform context window utilization. Future systems could implement sophisticated external memory

[PAGE 66]
66 Xu et al.

frameworks that maintain rich information representations outside the primary context window, accessing
them through efficient retrieval mechanisms when needed. Systems like Camel-AI/OWL [43] demonstrate
early steps with basic retrieval-augmented generation, but more comprehensive approaches could enable
effectively unlimited knowledge integration.
Research directions include developing differentiable retrieval mechanisms that seamlessly integrate
external knowledge within reasoning flows, implementing structured memory hierarchies that organize
information for efficient access, and designing memory-aware reasoning processes that explicitly consider
information availability when planning analytical approaches. These architectures could fundamentally
address context limitations while enhancing reasoning transparency and reliability.

8.1.2 Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Approaches. Integration of complementary reasoning paradigms offers signifi-
cant potential:
Neuro-Symbolic Integration. Current Deep Research systems rely primarily on neural approaches with
limited explicit reasoning structures. Future systems could integrate symbolic reasoning components that pro-
vide formal logical capabilities alongside neural flexibility, enhancing both reliability and explainability. Early
examples of this direction appear in systems like Camel-AI/OWL [43], which incorporates structured knowledge
representation within primarily neural architectures. Future research could develop more sophisticated
integration approaches that leverage the complementary strengths of both paradigms.
Implementation approaches might include explicit logical verification layers that validate neural-generated
reasoning, hybrid architectures that select appropriate reasoning mechanisms based on task characteristics,
or integrated systems that translate between symbolic and neural representations as needed throughout
complex workflows. These approaches could address current challenges in reliability and consistency while
maintaining the flexibility and generalization capabilities of neural foundations.
Advanced Knowledge Graph Integration. While current systems already incorporate basic knowledge graph
capabilities, future approaches could implement more sophisticated integration with dynamic, contextually-
aware knowledge structures. Beyond the entity relationship modeling seen in systems like
HKUDS/Auto-Deep-
Research [112], next-generation implementations could enable bidirectional updates where research findings
automatically refine and expand knowledge graphs while simultaneously leveraging them for reasoning. Such
approaches could incorporate uncertainty representation within graph structures, probabilistic reasoning
across knowledge networks, and adaptive abstraction hierarchies that transform between detailed and
high-level conceptual representations based on reasoning requirements. Research opportunities include
developing dynamic knowledge graph construction techniques that automatically build and refine structured
representations from unstructured sources, implementing graph-aware attention mechanisms that incorporate
relationship structures into neural reasoning, and designing hybrid querying approaches that combine graph
traversal with neural generation. These advances could enhance precision for complex reasoning tasks
requiring structured relationship understanding.

8.1.3 Causal Reasoning Enhancement. Moving beyond correlation to causal understanding represents a
crucial capability advancement:
Causal Inference Mechanisms. Current systems excel at identifying correlations but struggle with robust
causal analysis. Future research could develop specialized causal reasoning components that systematically
identify potential causal relationships, evaluate evidence quality, and assess alternative explanations. Recent

[PAGE 67]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 67

## 8.1 Advanced Reasoning Architectures (part 2)

work in healthcare research by Schuemie et al. [241] demonstrates the challenges of establishing confident
observational findings, highlighting the need for more sophisticated causal reasoning in research systems.
Early steps in this direction appear in systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], which incorporates basic
causal language in relationship descriptions. Other research explores the use of AI to assist in mining
causality, for instance, by searching for instrumental variables in economic analysis [105]. More sophisticated
approaches could enable reliable causal analysis across domains. Implementation opportunities include
developing causal graph construction techniques that explicitly model intervention effects and counterfactuals,
implementing causal uncertainty quantification that represents confidence in causal assertions, and designing
specialized prompt structures that guide causal reasoning through structured analytical patterns. These
advances could enhance research quality for domains where causal understanding is particularly crucial,
including medicine, social sciences, and policy analysis.
Intervention Modeling Techniques. Advanced causal understanding requires sophisticated intervention and
counterfactual reasoning capabilities. Future systems could incorporate explicit intervention modeling that
simulates potential actions and outcomes based on causal understanding, enhancing both explanatory and
predictive capabilities. Early examples of this direction appear in systems like Agent-RL/ReSearch [2], which
implements basic intervention simulation within reinforcement learning frameworks. More comprehensive
approaches could enable sophisticated what-if analysis across domains.
Research directions include developing counterfactual generation techniques that systematically explore
alternative scenarios based on causal models, implementing intervention optimization algorithms that
identify high-leverage action opportunities, and designing domain-specific intervention templates that embed
field-specific causal knowledge for common analysis patterns. These advances could enhance practical utility
for decision support applications requiring sophisticated action planning and outcome prediction.

8.1.4 Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning. Sophisticated uncertainty handling enhances both accuracy
and trustworthiness:
Multi-Dimensional Uncertainty Modeling. Current systems employ relatively simplistic uncertainty represen-
tations that inadequately capture different uncertainty types. Future research could develop multi-dimensional
uncertainty frameworks that separately represent epistemic uncertainty (knowledge limitations), aleatoric
uncertainty (inherent randomness), and model uncertainty (representation limitations). Early steps in
this direction appear in systems like Perplexity/DeepResearch [209], which distinguishes between source
uncertainty and integration uncertainty. More comprehensive approaches could enable more nuanced and
reliable uncertainty communication.
Implementation opportunities include developing uncertainty propagation mechanisms that track distinct
uncertainty types throughout reasoning chains, implementing uncertainty visualization techniques that
effectively communicate multi-dimensional uncertainty to users, and designing uncertainty-aware planning
algorithms that appropriately balance different uncertainty types in decision contexts. These advances could
enhance both system reliability and appropriate user trust calibration.
Bayesian Reasoning Integration. Probabilistic reasoning frameworks offer principled approaches to un-
certainty handling and knowledge integration. Future systems could incorporate explicit Bayesian rea-
soning components that systematically update beliefs based on evidence strength and prior knowledge,
enhancing both accuracy and explainability. Early examples of this direction appear in systems like

[PAGE 68]
68 Xu et al.

grapeot/deep_research_agent [263], which implements basic evidence weighting within research workflows.
More sophisticated integration could enable principled uncertainty handling across domains.
Research directions include developing scalable Bayesian inference techniques compatible with large-scale
language models, implementing belief update explanation mechanisms that communicate reasoning in
understandable terms, and designing domain-specific prior models that incorporate field-specific background
knowledge for common analysis patterns. These advances could enhance reasoning quality for domains with
inherent uncertainty or limited evidence.

## 8.2 Multi-Modal Deep Research (part 1)

8.2 Multi-Modal Deep Research
Expanding beyond text to incorporate diverse information modalities represents a significant advancement
opportunity.

8.2.1 Visual Information Integration. Image understanding dramatically expands information access and
analysis capabilities:
Scientific Image Analysis. Current systems demonstrate limited capabilities for extracting and interpreting
visual scientific content. Future research could develop specialized visual understanding components for
scientific images including graphs, diagrams, experimental images, and visualizations across domains. Early
steps in this direction appear in systems like Gemini/DeepResearch [60], which incorporates basic chart
extraction capabilities. Frameworks such as ChartCitor [96] provide fine-grained bounding box citations to
enhance explainability for complex chart understanding, improving user trust and productivity. Specialized
models like LHRS-Bot [180] demonstrate sophisticated reasoning capabilities for remote sensing imagery by
leveraging geographic information and multimodal learning. The development of large-scale, domain-specific
multimodal datasets for areas like entomology [272] and seafloor geology [188] is crucial for training more
capable models. More comprehensive approaches could enable sophisticated analysis of visual scientific
communication. Implementation opportunities include developing specialized scientific visualization parsers
that extract quantitative data from diverse chart types, implementing diagram understanding systems
that interpret complex scientific illustrations across domains, and designing domain-specific visual analysis
components optimized for field-specific imagery like medical scans or astronomical observations. These
advances could dramatically expand information access beyond text-centric sources.
Visual Evidence Integration. Effective research increasingly requires integration of visual evidence alongside
textual sources. Future systems could implement sophisticated multimodal reasoning that incorporates
visual evidence within comprehensive analytical frameworks, enabling true multimodal research synthesis.
Recent analyses have identified multi-modal integration as a key missing capability in current AI research
systems [315], highlighting the critical importance of cross-modal reasoning for scientific applications. Early
examples of this direction appear in systems like Gemini/DeepResearch [60], which provides basic integration
of image-derived information. More sophisticated approaches could enable balanced evidence integration
across modalities.

generate integrated understanding across information types. These advances could enhance research quality
for domains with significant visual information components.

8.2.2 Multimodal Source Analysis. Comprehensive understanding requires integrated analysis across diverse
information formats:
Video Content Processing. Video represents an increasingly important but currently underutilized infor-
mation source. Future research could develop specialized video understanding components that extract and
interpret temporal visual information, including presentations, interviews, demonstrations, and dynamic
processes. Initial steps in this direction are emerging in systems like OpenAI’s DALL-E 3, though not yet
integrated into Deep Research workflows. Comprehensive integration could enable access to the extensive
knowledge embedded in video content.
Implementation opportunities include developing lecture understanding systems that extract structured
knowledge from educational videos, implementing process analysis components that interpret demonstrations
and procedures, and designing integrated audio-visual analysis that combines visual information with spoken
content for comprehensive understanding. These advances could expand information access to the rapidly
growing corpus of video knowledge.
Audio Content Integration. Spoken information in podcasts, lectures, interviews, and discussions represents
a valuable knowledge source. Future systems could incorporate sophisticated audio processing that extracts,
interprets, and integrates spoken information within research workflows. Early examples of speech process-
ing appear in transcription services, but comprehensive research integration remains limited. Advanced
approaches could enable seamless incorporation of spoken knowledge alongside traditional text sources.
Research directions include developing speaker identification and attribution systems that maintain
appropriate source tracking for spoken content, implementing domain-specific terminology extraction that
accurately captures specialized vocabulary in varied acoustic conditions, and designing temporal alignment
techniques that connect spoken information with related textual or visual content. These advances could
expand information access while maintaining appropriate attribution and context.

8.2.3 Cross-Modal Reasoning Techniques. Effective multimodal research requires specialized reasoning
approaches across information types:
Multi-Modal Chain of Thought Reasoning. Current reasoning processes typically operate primarily within
single modalities despite handling diverse information types. Future systems could implement true multi-
modal reasoning chains that explicitly incorporate diverse information types throughout the analytical
process, not just in final outputs. Early steps appear in systems like Gemini/DeepResearch [60], which
demonstrates basic visual incorporation in reasoning steps. More sophisticated approaches could enable
reasoning flows that seamlessly transition between textual analysis, visual processing, numerical computation,
and spatial reasoning based on task requirements.
Research opportunities include developing explicit multi-modal reasoning protocols that formalize in-
formation transfer between modalities, implementing cross-modal verification techniques that leverage
complementary information types throughout reasoning chains, and designing unified representation frame-
works that enable coherent reasoning across diverse information formats. These advances could significantly
enhance reasoning quality for complex research tasks requiring integrated understanding across modalities,

[PAGE 70]
70 Xu et al.

## 8.2 Multi-Modal Deep Research (part 2)

moving beyond the current text-centric reasoning paradigms to more human-like analytical processes that
naturally leverage the most appropriate modality for each reasoning component.
Cross-Modal Consistency Verification. Integrating diverse information modalities introduces new consistency
challenges. Future research could develop specialized verification mechanisms that assess consistency across
textual, visual, numerical, and temporal information, enhancing overall reliability. Early steps in this direction
appear in systems like [60], which implements basic cross-format validation. More
Gemini/DeepResearch
sophisticated approaches could enable reliable integration of increasingly diverse information types.
Implementation opportunities include developing cross-modal contradiction detection algorithms that
identify conflicts between information expressed in different formats, implementing uncertainty alignment
techniques that reconcile confidence estimates across modalities, and designing multimodal fact verification
systems that leverage complementary evidence types for enhanced reliability. These advances could address
emerging challenges in multimodal information integration.
Multimodal Explanation Generation. Effective communication often requires coordinated explanation across
modalities. Future systems could generate truly multimodal research outputs that combine textual, visual,
and interactive components to enhance understanding and persuasiveness. Early examples of this direction
appear in systems like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249], which implements basic report visualization.
More comprehensive approaches could enable sophisticated multimodal communication tailored to content
requirements.
Research directions include developing coordinated generation architectures that produce aligned content
across modalities, implementing adaptive format selection algorithms that identify optimal representation
formats for different content types, and designing multimodal narrative structures that effectively combine
diverse formats within coherent explanatory frameworks. These advances could enhance communication
effectiveness across application domains.

# 8.3 Domain-Specific Optimization

Tailored enhancement for particular fields offers significant performance improvements for specialized
applications.

8.3.1 Scientific Domain Adaptation. Scientific research presents unique requirements and opportunities for
specialization:
Field-Specific Model Adaptation. Current systems employ relatively general architectures across scientific
domains. Future research could develop specialized adaptation techniques that optimize performance for
particular scientific fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and others with distinct knowledge structures
and reasoning patterns. Early steps in this direction appear in systems like AutoGLM-Research [330], which
implements domain-specific prompting. Domain-specialized research agents have demonstrated particular
promise in physics [305], chemistry [6, 34, 50, 326], materials science [189], oceanography [28], geospatial
analysis [165], patent research [227, 285], and broader scientific discovery workflows [84]. These specialized
implementations highlight the value of domain adaptation beyond general research capabilities. More
comprehensive adaptation could enable significant performance improvements for scientific applications.
Implementation approaches might include domain-specific fine-tuning regimes that emphasize field-relevant
reasoning patterns, specialized architectural modifications that enhance performance for domain-characteristic

[PAGE 71]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 71

tasks, or hybrid systems that incorporate symbolic components for domain-specific formal reasoning. These
approaches could address current limitations in scientific reasoning while maintaining general capabilities for
cross-domain research.
Scientific Workflow Integration. Effective scientific application requires integration with existing research
methodologies and tools. Future systems could implement specialized interfaces for scientific workflows
including experimental design, data analysis, literature integration, and theory development. Early examples
of this direction appear in systems like n8n [183], which provides workflow automation for data processing.
Platforms designed to support machine learning development in fundamental science also illustrate this
trend, enabling research in federated cloud environments [9]. More comprehensive integration could enable
seamless incorporation within scientific research processes. Research assistant tools employing prompt-based
templates demonstrate domain-agnostic support for tasks such as enhanced literature search queries and
preliminary peer review, facilitating standardized assistance across diverse scientific fields [245]. User studies
highlight varying automation needs across DS/ML workflows, suggesting targeted rather than complete
end-to-end automation aligns with researcher preferences [284]. Research opportunities include developing
experimental design assistants that generate and refine research protocols based on literature and objectives,
implementing integrated analysis pipelines that combine automated and human analytical components, and
designing theory development frameworks that link empirical findings with formal theoretical structures.
These advances could enhance practical scientific impact beyond general information access [44, 288].

8.3.2 Legal and Regulatory Domain Specialization. Legal applications present distinct challenges requiring
specialized adaptation:
Legal Reasoning Enhancement. Current systems struggle with the precision and structure of legal analysis.
Future research could develop specialized legal reasoning components that incorporate case-based reasoning,
statutory interpretation, and doctrinal analysis within coherent legal frameworks. Early steps in this direction
appear in systems like [197], which incorporates basic legal language handling. More
OpenAI/DeepResearch
comprehensive specialization could enable sophisticated legal applications across practice areas.
Implementation opportunities include developing case analysis systems that extract and apply relevant
precedent principles, implementing statutory interpretation frameworks that apply established analytical
methodologies to legislative text, and designing multi-jurisdictional reasoning approaches that navigate
conflicts of law across legal boundaries. These advances could enhance practical utility for legal research and
analysis applications.
Regulatory Compliance Specialization. Compliance applications require comprehensive coverage with
exceptional precision. Future systems could implement specialized compliance components that ensure
complete regulatory coverage, systematic obligation identification, and reliable guidance across complex
regulatory landscapes. Early examples of this direction appear in general information retrieval, but true
compliance optimization remains limited. Advanced approaches could enable reliable automation of currently
labor-intensive compliance processes.
Research directions include developing regulatory change tracking systems that monitor and interpret
evolving requirements, implementing obligation extraction techniques that identify and classify compliance
requirements across regulatory texts, and designing responsibility mapping approaches that connect regulatory

obligations with organizational functions and processes. These advances could enhance practical utility for
compliance-intensive industries facing complex regulatory environments.

8.3.3 Medical and Healthcare Research Support. Healthcare applications present unique requirements and
ethical considerations:
Clinical Evidence Synthesis. Medical applications require exceptional precision and comprehensive evidence
integration. Future research could develop specialized medical components that synthesize clinical evidence
across studies, guidelines, and practice observations while maintaining rigorous evaluation standards. Recent
efforts such as Google’s co-scientist project [97] demonstrate the potential for AI to assist in scientific research
including medical domains. Early steps in this direction appear in systems like Perplexity/DeepResearch
[209], which implements enhanced citation for medical claims. More comprehensive specialization could
enable reliable clinical decision support.
Implementation approaches might include evidence grading systems that apply established frameworks like
GRADE [21] to clinical research, meta-analysis components that systematically integrate quantitative findings
across studies, and guideline alignment techniques that map evidence to established clinical recommendations.
These advances could enhance practical utility for evidence-based medicine while maintaining appropriate
caution for this high-stakes domain.
Patient-Specific Research Adaptation. Personalized medicine requires adapting general knowledge to
individual patient contexts. Future systems could implement specialized personalization components that
adapt research findings based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, preferences, and other individual
factors. Early examples of this direction appear in basic filtering of contraindications, but comprehensive
personalization remains limited. Advanced approaches could enable truly personalized evidence synthesis for
clinical applications.
Research opportunities include developing comorbidity reasoning systems that adjust recommendations
based on condition interactions, implementing preference integration frameworks that incorporate patient
values in evidence synthesis, and designing personalized risk-benefit analysis approaches that quantify
individual trade-offs for treatment options. These advances could enhance clinical utility while respecting
the complexity of individual patient contexts.

8.4 Human-AI Collaboration and Standardization
Enhancing human-AI partnership and establishing common standards represent crucial directions for
practical research impact and ecosystem development.

8.4.1 Interactive Research Workflows. Effective collaboration requires sophisticated interaction throughout
the research process:
Adaptive Query Refinement. Current systems offer limited interaction during query formulation and
refinement. Future research could develop sophisticated refinement interfaces that collaboratively develop
research questions through iterative clarification, expansion, and focusing based on initial results and user
feedback. Early steps in this direction appear in systems like HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112], which
implements basic clarification dialogues, and benchmarks such as QuestBench [141], which evaluates
AI systems’ ability to identify missing information and formulate appropriate clarification questions in
underspecified reasoning tasks. More comprehensive approaches could enable truly collaborative question

technical users to effectively guide deep research processes through intuitive interaction patterns, while other
systems are exploring methods that go beyond standard retrieval-augmented generation to better handle
question identification in real-time conversations [4]. Implementation opportunities include developing intent
clarification systems that identify potential ambiguities and alternatives in research questions, implementing
scope adjustment interfaces that dynamically expand or narrow research focus based on initial findings, and
designing perspective diversification tools that suggest alternative viewpoints relevant to research objectives.
These advances could enhance research quality by improving question formulation through human-AI
collaboration.
Interactive Exploration Interfaces. Current systems typically present relatively static research outputs.
Future research could develop sophisticated exploration interfaces that enable dynamic navigation, drilling
down, and expansion across research findings based on evolving interests. Early examples of this direction
appear in systems like OpenManus [193], which provides basic exploration capabilities. Advanced approaches
could enable truly interactive research experiences tailored to discovery patterns.
Research directions include developing information visualization techniques specifically designed for
research navigation, implementing adaptive detail management that expands or collapses content areas
based on user interest signals, and designing seamless source transition mechanisms that enable smooth
movement between synthesis and original sources. These advances could enhance discovery by enabling more
exploratory and serendipitous research experiences.

8.4.2 Expertise Augmentation Models. Effective augmentation requires adaptation to user expertise and
objectives:
Expertise-Adaptive Interaction. Current systems offer limited adaptation to user knowledge levels and
expertise. Future research could develop sophisticated adaptation mechanisms that tailor research approaches,
explanations, and outputs based on user domain knowledge and research sophistication. Early steps in
this direction appear in systems like Perplexity/DeepResearch [209], which implements basic terminology
adjustment. More comprehensive adaptation could enable truly personalized research assistance aligned
with individual expertise.
Implementation approaches might include expertise inference systems that dynamically assess user knowl-
edge through interaction patterns, explanation adaptation mechanisms that adjust detail and terminology
based on expertise models, and knowledge gap identification tools that highlight potentially unfamiliar
concepts within research contexts. Furthermore, mechanisms that learn to strategically request expert
assistance when encountering gaps exceeding autonomous capability - as formalized in the Learning to Yield
and Request Control (YRC) coordination problem [66] - are crucial for optimizing intervention timing and
resolution effectiveness. These advances could enhance research effectiveness across diverse user populations
with varying domain familiarity.
Complementary Capability Design. Optimal augmentation leverages complementary human and AI
strengths. Future systems could implement specialized interfaces designed around capability complementarity,
emphasizing AI contributions in information processing while prioritizing human judgment for subjective
evaluation and contextual understanding. Early examples of this direction appear in systems like Agent-

[PAGE 74]
74 Xu et al.

RL/ReSearch [2], which implements basic division of analytical responsibilities. More sophisticated approaches
could enable truly synergistic human-AI research partnerships.
Research opportunities include developing explanation components specifically designed to facilitate
human judgment rather than replace it, implementing confidence signaling mechanisms that highlight areas
particularly requiring human evaluation, and designing interactive critique frameworks that enable efficient
human feedback on system reasoning. Feng Xiong et al. [303] redefine the collaborative dynamics between
human researchers and AI systems. These advances could enhance collaborative effectiveness by optimizing
around natural capability distributions.

8.4.3 Framework Standardization Efforts. Common architectures enable modular development and component
interoperability:
Component Interface Standardization. Advanced implementations employ standardized interfaces be-
tween major system components. The OpenAI/AgentsSDK [199] defines explicit interface standards for
agent components, enabling modular development and component substitution. Emerging industry stan-
dards like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) [12] provide standardized interaction frameworks
for large language models and tools, enabling consistent integration patterns across implementations.
Similarly, Google’s Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) [90, 92] establishes standardized communication pat-
terns between autonomous agents, facilitating reliable multi-agent coordination. Open-source alternatives
like smolagents/open_deep_research [115] implement comparable messaging protocols between agent
components, highlighting industry convergence toward standardized interaction patterns. Projects like
[8] further demonstrate how standardized protocols enable effective collaboration be-
Open_deep_search
tween specialized research agents. Integration of diverse API interactions, as explored in Toolllm [223],
provides additional standardization opportunities for managing external tool usage within research workflows.
Evaluation Metric Standardization. Current evaluation practices vary widely across implementations.
Future research could establish standardized evaluation frameworks that enable consistent assessment and
comparison across systems and components. Early examples of this direction appear in benchmarks like
HLE [212] and MMLU [33], but comprehensive standardization remains limited. Advanced standardization
could enable more efficient development through reliable quality signals and clear improvement metrics.
Research opportunities include developing standardized benchmark suites targeting specific research
capabilities, implementing common evaluation methodologies across research domains and applications,
and designing multi-dimensional assessment frameworks that provide nuanced performance profiles beyond
simple accuracy metrics. These advances could enhance ecosystem quality by establishing clear standards
and highlighting genuine improvements.

## 8.4 Human-AI Collaboration and Standardization (part 2)

8.4.4 Cross-Platform Research Protocols. Interoperability across diverse systems enhances collective capabili-
ties:
Research Result Exchange Formats. Current systems typically produce outputs in incompatible formats.
Future research could develop standardized exchange formats that enable seamless sharing of research
results across platforms and systems, enhancing collective capabilities. Early steps in this direction appear
in basic document formats, but true research-specific standardization remains limited. Comprehensive
standardization could enable research workflows spanning multiple specialized systems.

[PAGE 75]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 75

Implementation opportunities include defining standard structures for research findings with appropriate
attribution and confidence metadata, establishing common formats for evidence representation across systems,
and developing shared schemas for research questions and objectives to enable distributed processing. These
advances could enhance capability through specialization and complementary system utilization.
Distributed Research Coordination. Advanced interoperability enables coordinated research across systems
with complementary capabilities. Future research could develop sophisticated coordination frameworks that
enable multi-system research workflows with appropriate task allocation, result integration, and process
management. Early examples of this direction appear in workflows like those enabled by n8n [183], but
comprehensive research-specific coordination remains limited. Advanced approaches could enable truly
distributed research ecosystems with specialized components addressing distinct process elements.
Research directions include developing distributed search coordination protocols that efficiently leverage
specialized search capabilities, implementing cross-system result verification techniques that ensure consis-
tency across distributed findings, and designing efficient coordination protocols that minimize communication
overhead in distributed research workflows. These advances could enhance collective capability through
specialization and parallelization across the ecosystem.

8.4.5 Joint Human-AI Knowledge Creation. Moving beyond information retrieval to collaborative insight
generation:
Collaborative Creation Environments. Advanced collaboration requires sophisticated content co-creation
capabilities. Future research could develop specialized collaborative environments that enable fluid transition
between human and AI contributions within unified document development. Early steps in this direction
appear in systems like mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher , which implements basic collaborative document gener-
ation. Advanced interfaces like those explored in Self-Explanation in Social AI Agents [23] demonstrate how
explanation capabilities can enhance collaborative research through more transparent reasoning processes.
Similarly, innovative interaction paradigms like AI-Instruments [232] show how prompts can be embodied
as instruments to abstract and reflect commands as general-purpose tools, suggesting novel approaches
to research interface design that enhance collaborative capabilities through intuitive interaction patterns.
Approaches where AI agents learn to assist other agents by observing them also show promise for developing
more effective collaborative behaviors [127]. Effidit demonstrates comprehensive writing support through
multifunctional capabilities including text polishing and context-aware phrase refinement, extending collabo-
rative editing beyond basic generation [248]. More comprehensive approaches could enable truly integrated
co-creation experiences.
Implementation opportunities include developing section suggestion systems that propose potential
content expansions based on document context, implementing stylistic adaptation mechanisms that align
AI-generated content with established document voice and approach, and incorporating implicit feedback
mechanisms that interpret rejected suggestions as negative signals to refine outputs while preserving original
intent [271], and designing seamless revision interfaces that enable efficient editing across human and AI
contributions, like iterative human-AI co-editing as demonstrated by REVISE [302] – a framework allowing
writers to dynamically modify summary segments through fill-in-the-middle generation. These advances
could enhance collaborative productivity by reducing friction in joint content development [116].

[PAGE 76]
76 Xu et al.

Mixed-Initiative Research Design. Sophisticated collaboration includes shared determination of research
direction and approach. Future systems could implement mixed-initiative frameworks that dynamically
balance direction setting between human preferences and AI-identified opportunities throughout the research
process. Early examples of this direction appear in systems like smolagents/open_deep_research [115],
which implements basic suggestion mechanisms. Advanced approaches could enable truly collaborative
research planning with balanced initiative distribution.
Research directions include developing opportunity identification systems that highlight promising but
unexplored research directions, implementing trade-off visualization techniques that communicate potential
research path alternatives and implications, and designing preference elicitation frameworks that efficiently
capture evolving research priorities throughout the process, and integrating explainable reward function
mechanisms to enhance human understanding of AI’s decision logic, thereby improving collaborative efficiency
in value alignment contexts [239]. These advances could enhance discovery by combining human insight
with AI-identified opportunities in balanced partnerships.
The future research directions outlined in this section highlight both the significant potential for advance-
ment and the multi-faceted nature of Deep Research development. Progress will likely emerge through comple-
mentary advances across reasoning architectures, multimodal capabilities, domain specialization, human-AI
collaboration, and ecosystem standardization. While commercial implementations like OpenAI/DeepResearch
[197], Gemini/DeepResearch [60], and Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] will undoubtedly drive significant
innovation, open-source alternatives and academic research will play crucial roles in expanding the boundaries
of what’s possible and ensuring broad participation in this rapidly evolving field.

9 Conclusion

This survey has examined the rapidly evolving domain of Deep Research systems, tracing their development
from initial implementations in 2023 through the sophisticated ecosystem emerging in 2025. Through
comprehensive analysis of commercial offerings like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], Gemini/DeepResearch
[60], and Perplexity/DeepResearch [209], alongside open-source alternatives including HKUDS/Auto-Deep-
Research [112], dzhng/deep-research [321], and numerous others, we have identified key technical patterns,
implementation approaches, and application opportunities that characterize this transformative technology
domain.

# 9.1 Key Findings and Contributions

Our analysis reveals several fundamental insights about the current state and trajectory of Deep Research
systems:

Technical Architecture Patterns. Effective Deep Research implementations demonstrate consistent architec-
tural patterns across foundation models, environmental interaction, task planning, and knowledge synthesis
dimensions. Commercial implementations like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Gemini/DeepResearch [60]
typically leverage proprietary foundation models with extensive context lengths and sophisticated reasoning
capabilities, while open-source alternatives like Camel-AI/OWL [43] and QwenLM/Qwen-Agent [224] demon-
strate how effective research capabilities can be achieved with more accessible models through specialized

[184] and dzhng/deep-research [321] demonstrating exceptional effectiveness in web navigation and content
extraction, while comprehensive platforms like Manus [164] and AutoGLM-Search [330] offer broader interaction
capabilities across multiple environments. These patterns highlight both the value of specialization and the
importance of comprehensive environmental access for effective research.
Task planning and execution approaches reveal similar diversity, with frameworks like
OpenAI/AgentsSDK
[199] and Flowith/OracleMode [77] providing sophisticated planning capabilities, while systems like Agent-
RL/ReSearch [2] and smolagents/open_deep_research [115] emphasize execution reliability and collabora-
tive approaches respectively. Knowledge synthesis capabilities demonstrate consistent emphasis on information
evaluation, though with varied approaches to presentation and interactivity across implementations like
HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] and mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher [249].

Implementation Approach Distinctions. Our analysis highlights meaningful distinctions between commer-
cial and open-source implementation approaches. Commercial platforms typically offer optimized performance,
sophisticated interfaces, and comprehensive capabilities, though with associated costs and customization
limitations. Systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] demonstrate
exceptional performance on standard benchmarks, though with significant variation in application focus and
interaction models.
Open-source implementations demonstrate greater architectural diversity and customization flexibil-
ity, though typically with increased deployment complexity and more limited performance on stan-
dard benchmarks. Projects like dzhng/deep-research [321], nickscamara/open-deep-research [42], and
HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] offer complete research pipelines with varied architectural approaches,
while specialized components like Jina-AI/node-DeepResearch [121] and Nanobrowser [184] enable cus-
tomized workflows addressing specific requirements. Frameworks such as AutoChain [78] provide lightweight
tools to simplify the creation and evaluation of custom generative agents, enabling rapid iteration for
specialized applications.
These distinctions highlight complementary roles within the ecosystem, with commercial implementations
offering accessibility and performance for general users, while open-source alternatives enable customization,
control, and potentially lower operational costs for specialized applications and high-volume usage. This
diversity enhances overall ecosystem health through competition, specialization, and diverse innovation
paths.

Application Domain Adaptations. Our examination of application patterns reveals meaningful adaptations
across domains including academic research[118, 273, 276], scientific discovery[6, 10, 25, 47, 79, 83, 98, 99,
110, 129, 130, 135, 155, 166, 169, 218, 255, 258, 264, 269, 310, 312, 322, 327], business intelligence[187],
financial analysis, education[14, 215, 219, 317], and personal knowledge management[136, 336]. Academic
applications exemplified by systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Camel-AI/OWL [43] demonstrate
particular emphasis on comprehensive literature coverage, methodological understanding, and citation
quality. Scientific implementations like Gemini/DeepResearch [60] and Agent-RL/ReSearch [2] emphasize
experimental design, data analysis, and theory development capabilities.
Business applications leveraging systems like Manus [164] and n8n [183] show stronger focus on information
currency, competitive analysis, and actionable insight generation. Educational implementations demonstrate

[PAGE 78]
78 Xu et al.

adaptations for learning support, content development, and research skill training across systems like
Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] and OpenManus [193]. These patterns highlight how general deep research
capabilities translate into domain value through specialized adaptation addressing field-specific requirements
and workflows.

Ethical Consideration Approaches. Our analysis reveals both common patterns and implementation diver-
sity in addressing crucial ethical dimensions including information accuracy, privacy protection, intellectual
property respect, and accessibility. Commercial implementations typically demonstrate sophisticated ap-
proaches to factual verification, with systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197] and Perplexity/DeepResearch
[209] implementing multi-level verification and explicit attribution, while open-source alternatives like
[263] and [112] demonstrate pragmatic ap-
grapeot/deep_research_agent HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research
proaches within more constrained technical environments.
Privacy protection shows similar patterns, with commercial systems implementing comprehensive safe-
guards appropriate to their cloud-based operation, while open-source alternatives like OpenManus [193]
emphasize local deployment for sensitive applications. Attribution and intellectual property approaches
demonstrate consistent emphasis on source transparency and appropriate utilization boundaries, though
with varied implementation sophistication across the ecosystem.
These patterns highlight both shared ethical priorities across the ecosystem and implementation diversity
reflecting different technical constraints, deployment models, and user requirements. This diversity represents
a strength in addressing multi-faceted ethical challenges through complementary approaches and continuous
innovation.

# 9.2 Limitations and Outlook

While this survey provides comprehensive analysis of current Deep Research systems and emerging trends,
several limitations warrant acknowledgment:

Rapidly Evolving Landscape. The accelerating pace of development in this domain presents inherent
challenges for comprehensive analysis. New systems and capabilities continue to emerge, with commercial
offerings like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197], Gemini/DeepResearch [60], and Perplexity/DeepResearch [209]
receiving frequent updates, while the open-source ecosystem continuously expands through new projects
and enhancements to existing frameworks like dzhng/deep-research [321] and HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research
[112].
This survey captures the state of the art as of early 2025, but both technical capabilities and implementation
approaches will continue to evolve rapidly. The classification framework and analysis methodology provided
here offer a structural foundation for continued assessment as the field progresses through subsequent
development phases.

Implementation Detail Limitations. Comprehensive technical analysis faces challenges due to limited
implementation transparency, particularly for commercial systems. While open-source implementations

ination, commercial systems like [197] and [60] reveal limited
OpenAI/DeepResearch Gemini/DeepResearch
internal details, restricting comprehensive comparative analysis of certain technical dimensions.

[PAGE 79]
A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications 79

Our approach addresses this limitation through behavioral analysis, publicly available documentation
examination, and consistent evaluation across standardized benchmarks and qualitative assessment frame-
works. These methods enable meaningful comparison despite transparency variations, though complete
architectural analysis remains challenging for proprietary implementations.

Application Impact Assessment. Evaluating real-world impact presents persistent challenges given the
early deployment stage of many Deep Research systems. While initial applications demonstrate promis-
ing capabilities across domains including academic research[17, 208, 225, 292], business intelligence, and
education[14, 215, 317], a comprehensive long-term impact assessment requires extended observation beyond
the scope of this survey. Potential transformative effects on research methodologies, knowledge work, and
information access patterns remain partially speculative despite encouraging early indications.
Future research should incorporate longitudinal analysis of deployment patterns, usage evolution, and
organizational integration to assess realized impact beyond technical capabilities and early applications.
Such analysis would complement the technical and architectural focus of the current survey with valuable
perspectives on practical significance and societal implications.

# 9.3 Broader Implications

Beyond specific findings, this survey highlights several broader implications for the future of knowledge work
and information access:

Research Methodology Transformation. Deep Research systems demonstrate potential to fundamentally
transform research methodologies across domains. The comprehensive information access, advanced reasoning
capabilities, and efficient knowledge synthesis demonstrated by systems like OpenAI/DeepResearch [197],
Gemini/DeepResearch [60], and their open-source alternatives suggest significant opportunities to accelerate
discovery, enhance comprehensiveness, and enable novel cross-domain connections beyond traditional research
approaches.
Rather than simply automating existing processes, these systems enable fundamentally new research
approaches leveraging capabilities exceeding human information processing in scale while complementing
human insight, creativity, and contextual understanding. This complementarity suggests evolution toward
collaborative research models rather than replacement of human researchers, with significant potential
for productivity enhancement and discovery acceleration. However, Ashktorab et al. [15] highlight that in
human-AI collaboration, users may exhibit overreliance behaviors, appending AI-generated responses even
when conflicting, which can compromise data quality.

Knowledge Access Democratization. The emergence of accessible Deep Research implementations across
commercial and open-source ecosystems demonstrates potential for broader knowledge democratization.
Systems like Perplexity/DeepResearch [209] with free access tiers and open-source alternatives like
nickscamara/open-deep-research [42] and HKUDS/Auto-Deep-Research [112] enable sophisticated research
capabilities previously requiring specialized expertise and substantial resources, potentially reducing barriers
to high-quality information access and analysis.
This democratization carries significant implications for education, entrepreneurship, civic participation,
and individual knowledge development. While accessibility challenges remain, particularly regarding technical

[PAGE 80]

expertise requirements and computational resources, the overall trajectory suggests broadening access to
advanced research capabilities with potential positive impacts on knowledge equity across society.

Collective Intelligence Enhancement. Beyond individual applications, Deep Research systems demonstrate
potential for collective intelligence enhancement through improved knowledge integration, insight sharing, and
collaborative discovery. The capabilities demonstrated by systems like Manus [164], Flowith/OracleMode [77],
and smolagents/open_deep_research [115] suggest opportunities for enhanced knowledge synthesis across
organizational and disciplinary boundaries, potentially addressing fragmentation challenges in increasingly
complex knowledge domains.
Rather than viewing these systems as isolated tools, their integration into collaborative knowledge
ecosystems highlights potential for systemic enhancement of collective sense-making, evidence-based decision
making, and shared understanding development. This perspective emphasizes the social and organizational
dimensions of Deep Research impact beyond technical capabilities and individual productivity enhancement.
